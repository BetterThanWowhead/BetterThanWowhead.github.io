The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. Once you know these areas you can start using your wings more aggressively and your overall throughput will increase significantly. The biggest thing you wan't to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you use wings you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Bubble if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in the dungeons.

### **De Other Side:**

 **Hakkar the Soulflayer:**

 You generally wan't to have Aura Mastery on the first barrier to get one more usage later in the fight, also can use short defensives like Divine Protection and have it back up for third, sixth and so on. Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice can be used if your group falls behind on killing the adds and a Blood Barrier is about to happen. You can also Hammer of Justice them and Blessing of Protection the fixate to mitigate damage.

**Dealer Xy'exa:**

The key to kill this boss is managing the lightning properly, pass it between your tank, tankiest dps and yourself, Pooling holy power for the lighting will make this boss fight easier to deal with. If one of your players doesn't have a defensive for the overlap (bomb with lightning debuff) use Blessing of Sacrifice immediately. If you get the overlap then bubble, make sure to rotate your own personals for the overlap if you get it multiple times Divine Protection, Aura Mastery or Bubble you can also ask for a slow fall to mitigate the fall damage (if you have a mage). [Soul Treads](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323609/soul-treads) these boots enchant will reduce your fall damage by 10%.

**The Manastorms:**

There's not really a lot to talk about cooldown whise on this boss, but if one of your players get targetet by Shadowfury and for some reasson dont have a defensiv available for the group wide AOE damage overlap, Blessing of Sacrifice him immediately to keep him from dying. If your tank getting overwhelmed by the debuff in phase two and starts dropping really low, you can use Blessing of Protection on him, but make sure hes aware your about to do it since he loses all threat from the boss.

Since pressing the bombs is a healer job on this fight, keybinding mouseover interact will help you a ton.

**Mueh'Zala:**

There's two ways to play this boss, you either one phase or you two phase it. If your group decides to one phase, you typically wan't to hold your wings for the add. But this is not necessary if you two phase since you will have one extra dps on your side to help you kill the add. Other than that you wan't to dispel one player on Cosmic Collapse, you can also use Aura Mastery on one to mitigate damage.

### **Sanguine Depths:**

**Kryxis:**

If you're a new holy paladin player you might find yourself having a hard time on this boss fight. You wan't to make sure to split your cooldowns and have something for every wave of orbs for example, Ashen + Wings for first wave, Aura Mastery + Holy Avenger for second wave and lastly Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice for third wave. If your group happens to have a more optimised composition like a Rogue and a Mage, you could Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice, Cloak and Ice Block one wave which will make the boss fight significantly easier. If your grp is not healthy before a Juggernaut Rush you can always use Blessing of Protection on the targeted target and let him solo soak.

**Executor Tarvold:**

The most important thing to do on this boss is thinking ahead of time and tracking your dps players damage cooldowns, also knowing when the dangerous Castigate and add overlap happens (first one will happen on the second add spawn) make sure the targeted player uses a immunity or if they don't have one, use Blessing of Sacrifice on them. You generally wan't to use Wings + Ashen Hallow at start of fight since you will have 10 stacks of the damage buff this will cover the first add, no damage mitigation cooldowns should be used here. Second add would most likely be Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice since its a overlap, Third add would be Holy Avenger + Aura Mastery.


**Grand Proctor Beryllia:**

Collecting orbs good and rotating immunities is the thing that will make the biggest difference on this boss. You ideally want to use Aura Mastery on the first Rite of Supremacy late to have the damage reduction rolling for the Endless Torment aswell, the second Endless Torment you would use Holy Avenger, third is Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice on your most squishy dps and lastly Ashen Hallow + Wings. This being said you can still use Wings on pull and have it back up for the forth Endless Torment also depending on your group composition and route you might have to play differently.

**General Kaal:**

This fight is pretty stright forward, you can avoid getting the bleed by using Door of Shadows or Divine Steed. If you see a player is about to get 2 stacks of the debuff you can use Blessing of Protection to clear and immune the charge hit. Keep in mind that the shield clears all bleeds so you ideally do not wan't to use Blessing of Protection before Gloom Squall, or any sort of immunity in general.

**Important trash mechanics to use Blessing of Protection or Freedom on:**

**Chamber Sentinel's Severing Slice:** This is the frontal the sentinel does, if one of your dps gets hit meanwhile your tank are kiting, Blessing of Protection will fully immune it. You can also soak the bleed intentionally to help your tank (but make sure he's aware your about to do it).

**Research Scribe's Throw Research:** This mob will stand still and cast books on random players, and the damage will scale really high the higher the key level is. Using Blessing of Protection will mitigate a lot of this damage.

**Grand Overseer's Dread Bindings:** You can pre Freedom this mechanic and you won't have to run out to break the chain.

**Depths Warden's Barbed Shackles:** This ability should be interrupted but if it would happen to go through use Freedom immediately.
