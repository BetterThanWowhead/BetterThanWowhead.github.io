### **How to use your cooldowns?**

The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. Once you know these areas you can start using your wings more aggressively and your overall throughput will increase significantly. The biggest thing you wan't to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you use wings you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Bubble if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in the dungeons.

### **De Other Side:**

 **Hakkar the Soulflayer:**

 You generally wan't to have Aura Mastery on the first barrier to get one more usage later in the fight, also can use short defensives like Divine Protection and have it back up for third, sixth and so on. Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice can be used if your group falls behind on killing the adds, you can also Hammer of Justice them and Blessing of Protection the fixate to mitigate damage.

**Dealer Xy'exa:**

The key to kill this boss is managing the lightning properly, pass it between your tank, tankiest dps and yourself, Pooling holy power for the lighting will make this boss fight easier to deal with. If one of your players doesn't have a defensive for the overlap (bomb with lightning debuff) use Blessing of Sacrifice immediately or Aura Mastery if Blessing of Sacrifice is not available. If you get the overlap then bubble, if you get the overlap multiple times you either need a slow fall from your mage (if you have one) or you're most likely dead.

**The Manastorms:**

There's not really a lot to talk about cooldown whise on this boss, but if one of your players get targetet by Shadowfury and for some reasson dont have a defensiv available for the group wide AOE damage overlap, Blessing of Sacrifice him immediately to keep him from dying. If your tank getting overwhelmed by the debuff in phase two and starts dropping really low, you can use Blessing of Protection on him, but make sure hes aware your about to do it since he loses all threat from the boss.

Since pressing the bombs is a healer job on this fight, keybinding mouseover interact will help you a ton.

**Mueh'Zala:**

There's two ways to play this boss, you either one phase or two phase. If your group decides to one phase, you typically wanna hold your wings for the add. But this is not necessary if you two phase since you will have one extra dps on your side to help you kill the add. Other than that you wanna dispel one player on every debuff, you can also Aura Mastery one to mitigate damage.
