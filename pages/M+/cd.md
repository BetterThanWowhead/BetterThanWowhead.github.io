The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. Once you know these areas you can start using your 
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath" data-wowhead="spell=31884"></a> more aggressively and your overall throughput will increase significantly. The biggest thing you wan't to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you use Avenging Wrath you ideally don’t want to use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in the dungeons.

### **De Other Side:**

 **Hakkar the Soulflayer:**

 You generally wan't to have 
 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> on the first barrier to get one more usage later in the fight, also can use short defensives like 
 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=498/divine-protection" data-wowhead="spell=498"></a> and have it back up for third, sixth and so on. 
 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> + 
 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> can be used if your group falls behind on killing the adds and a Blood Barrier is about to happen. You can also 
 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=853/hammer-of-justice" data-wowhead="spell=853"></a> them and 
 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" data-wowhead="spell=1022"></a> the fixate to mitigate damage.

**Dealer Xy'exa:**

The key to kill this boss is managing the lightning properly, pass it between your tank, tankiest dps and yourself, Pooling holy power for the lighting will make this boss fight easier to deal with. If one of your players doesn't have a defensive for the overlap (bomb with lightning debuff) use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> on them immediately. If you get the overlap then <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a>, make sure to rotate your own personals for the overlap if you get it multiple times 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=498/divine-protection" data-wowhead="spell=498"></a>, 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> you can also ask for a slow fall to mitigate the fall damage (if you have a mage).

**The Manastorms:**

There's not really a lot to talk about cooldown whise on this boss, but if one of your players get targetet by Shadowfury and for some reasson dont have a defensiv available for the group wide AOE damage overlap, 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> him immediately to keep him from dying. If your tank getting overwhelmed by the debuff in phase two and starts dropping really low, you can use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" data-wowhead="spell=1022"></a> on him, but make sure hes aware your about to do it since he loses all threat from the boss.

Since pressing the bombs is a healer job on this fight, keybinding mouseover interact will help you a ton.

**Mueh'Zala:**

There's two ways to play this boss, you either one phase or you two phase it. If your group decides to one phase, you typically wan't to hold your 
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath" data-wowhead="spell=31884"></a> for the add. But this is not necessary if you two phase since you will have one extra dps on your side to help you kill the add. Other than that you wan't to 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=4987/cleanse" data-wowhead="spell=4987"></a> one player on Cosmic Collapse, you can also use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> on one to mitigate damage.

### **Sanguine Depths:**

**Kryxis:**

If you're a new holy paladin player you might find yourself having a hard time on this boss fight. You wan't to make sure to split your cooldowns and have something for every wave of orbs for example, 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316958/ashen-hallow" data-wowhead="spell=316958"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=66011/avenging-wrath" data-wowhead="spell=66011"></a> for first wave, 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809/holy-avenger" data-wowhead="spell=105809"></a> for second wave and lastly 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> for third wave. If your group happens to have a more optimised composition like a Rogue and a Mage, you could 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a>, Cloak and Ice Block one wave which will make the boss fight significantly easier. If your grp is not healthy before a Juggernaut Rush you can always use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" data-wowhead="spell=1022"></a> on the targeted target and let him solo soak.

**Executor Tarvold:**

The most important thing to do on this boss is thinking ahead of time and tracking your dps players damage cooldowns, also knowing when the dangerous Castigate and add overlap happens (first one will happen on the second add spawn) make sure the targeted player uses a immunity or if they don't have one, use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> on them. You generally wan't to use 
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath" data-wowhead="spell=31884"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316958/ashen-hallow" data-wowhead="spell=316958"></a> at start of fight since you will have 10 stacks of the damage buff this will cover the first add, no damage mitigation cooldowns should be used here. Second add would most likely be 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> since its a overlap, Third add would be <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809/holy-avenger" data-wowhead="spell=105809"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a>.


**Grand Proctor Beryllia:**

Collecting orbs good and rotating immunities is the thing that will make the biggest difference on this boss. You ideally want to use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> on the first Rite of Supremacy late to have the damage reduction rolling for the Endless Torment aswell, the second Endless Torment you would use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809/holy-avenger" data-wowhead="spell=105809"></a>, third is 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> + 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> on your most squishy dps and lastly 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316958/ashen-hallow" data-wowhead="spell=316958"></a> + 
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath" data-wowhead="spell=31884"></a>. This being said you can still use 
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath" data-wowhead="spell=31884"></a> on pull and have it back up for the forth Endless Torment also depending on your group composition and route you might have to play differently.

**General Kaal:**

This fight is pretty stright forward, you can avoid getting the bleed by using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=300728/door-of-shadows" data-wowhead="spell=300728"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190784/divine-steed" data-wowhead="spell=190784"></a>. If you see a player is about to get 2 stacks of the debuff you can use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" data-wowhead="spell=1022"></a> to clear and immune the charge hit. Keep in mind that the shield clears all bleeds so you ideally do not wan't to use any sort of immunity before Gloom Squall.

**Important trash mechanics to use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" data-wowhead="spell=1022"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1044/blessing-of-freedom" data-wowhead="spell=1044"></a> on:**

**Chamber Sentinel's Severing Slice:** This is the frontal the sentinel does, if one of your dps gets hit meanwhile your tank are kiting, Blessing of Protection will fully immune it. You can also soak the bleed intentionally to help your tank (but make sure he's aware your about to do it).

**Research Scribe's Throw Research:** This mob will stand still and cast books on random players, and the damage will scale really high the higher the key level is. Using Blessing of Protection will mitigate a lot of this damage.

**Grand Overseer's Dread Bindings:** You can pre use Freedom on this mechanic and you won't have to run out to break the chain.

**Depths Warden's Barbed Shackles:** This ability should be interrupted but if it would happen to go through use Freedom immediately.

### **Plaguefall**

**Globgrog:**

Healing this boss is very simple, you wanna prioritize using 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=4987/cleanse" data-wowhead="spell=4987"></a> on the most squishy player in your group and when your dispel comes back off from the cooldown, you can dispel whoever is in most danger. If someone are not topped before a plaguestomp you can use either 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> on them. Keep in mind that 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" data-wowhead="spell=1022"></a> will prevent the knockback and also add a 10% damage reduction if you are using the 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339316/echoing-blessings" data-wowhead="spell=339316"></a> conduit.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=853/hammer-of-justice" data-wowhead="spell=853"></a>, 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=115750/blinding-light" data-wowhead="spell=115750"></a> and 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=145067/turn-evil" data-wowhead="spell=145067"></a> works on the slimes.

**Doctor ickus:**

Only thing you have to do on this fight is using 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=4987/cleanse" data-wowhead="spell=4987"></a> the slime injection. I would suggest using 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316958/ashen-hallow" data-wowhead="spell=316958"></a> on the last platform to skip the bomb completly and instead killing the boss if your grp is somewhat coordinated, if not you can use whenever your group does not have a lot of damage. Using 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=145067/turn-evil" data-wowhead="spell=145067"></a> on the purple oze will save you a ton of time since you can ignore killing it completly and keep it CCd for the rest of the fight.

**Domina Venomblade:**

The most dangerous thing on this boss to be aware of is getting multiple Shadow Ambushes in a row, if you are very unlucky you can get 4-5 in a row and its important that you are not using your 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=498/divine-protection" data-wowhead="spell=498"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> randomly. If this happens you want to 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=498/divine-protection" data-wowhead="spell=498"></a> the first one, you can either 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> or 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a> on the second Shadow Ambush i personally prefer to use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" data-wowhead="spell=642"></a> for damage, the third one would be 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=498/divine-protection" data-wowhead="spell=498"></a> again and lastly 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=317929/aura-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=317929"></a>. When the boss summons Brood Assasins and you do not have any throughput cooldowns, you can use 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6940/blessing-of-sacrifice" data-wowhead="spell=6940"></a> on the tank.

**Margrave stradama:**

Healing this fight can be very difficult, so its important that you play well with your cooldowns and always think ahead what cooldowns you will use on on the next Acid Rain. Dependin on your group composition you will either use Ashen Hallow in phase two or phase three, usually if you don't play with a boomkin you use Ashen Hallow in phase two. This means you would use Holy Avenger on the first Acid Rain, the second rain would be Aura Mastery (this is hopefully the last rain in phase one). Ashen + Wings should cover the second phase and no defensive cooldowns should be used here. In phase three the first rain would be Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice and the second rain you should have Holy Avenger back up. You wan't to dispel your most squishy dps on 2 stacks, this way you get to dispel twice and will mitigate the most damage.

**Important trash mechanics to use Blessing of Protection or Freedom on:**

**Rigged Plagueborer's Wretched Phlegm:** Using freedom BEFORE the cast is finished will fully immune the damage, and can be used on every second plagueborer cast.

**Slime Tentacle's Crushing Embrace:** Every now and then the tentacle will grip one of your players, you can either Hammer of Justice, Blinding Light, Freedom or use Blessing of Protection to break them free.

**Plaguebinder's Gripping Infection:** You need to use Freedom on this since You don't wan't to use your dispel on this mechanic since you need to save it for the debuff the slimeclaws puts on your tank or closest target.
