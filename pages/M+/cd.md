How to use your cooldowns.

The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. Once you know these areas you can start using your wings more aggresivly and your overall throughput will increase dramatically. The biggest thing you wanna be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you wings you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Bubble if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit since that’s only thing that makes us viable so lets talk about cd usage in the dungeons.
