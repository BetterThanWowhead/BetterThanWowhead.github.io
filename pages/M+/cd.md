### **How to use your cooldowns?**

The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. Once you know these areas you can start using your wings more aggressively and your overall throughput will increase dramatically. The biggest thing you wan't to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you use wings you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Bubble if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in the dungeons.

### **De Other Side:**


 #### **Hakkar the Soulflayer:**

 You generally wan't to have Aura Mastery on the first barrier to get one more usage later in the fight, also can use short defensives like Divine Protection and have it back up for third, sixth and so on. Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice can be used if your group falls behind on killing the adds, you can also Hammer of Justice them and Blessing of Protection the fixate to mitigate damage.

#### **Dealer Xy'exa:**

The key to kill this boss is managing the lightning properly, pass it between your tank, tankiest dps and yourself, Pooling holy power for the lighting will make this boss fight easier to deal with. If one of your players doesn't have a defensive for the overlap (bomb with lightning debuff) use Blessing of Sacrifice immediately or Aura Mastery if Blessing of Sacrifice is not available. If you get the overlap then bubble, if you get the overlap multiple times you either need a slow fall from your mage (if you have one) you're most likely dead.

#### **Mueh'Zala:**
