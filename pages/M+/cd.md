The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. Once you know these areas you can start using your wings more aggressively and your overall throughput will increase significantly. The biggest thing you wan't to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you use wings you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Bubble if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in the dungeons.

### **De Other Side:**

 **Hakkar the Soulflayer:**

 You generally wan't to have Aura Mastery on the first barrier to get one more usage later in the fight, also can use short defensives like Divine Protection and have it back up for third, sixth and so on. Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice can be used if your group falls behind on killing the adds and a Blood Barrier is about to happen. You can also Hammer of Justice them and Blessing of Protection the fixate to mitigate damage.

**Dealer Xy'exa:**

The key to kill this boss is managing the lightning properly, pass it between your tank, tankiest dps and yourself, Pooling holy power for the lighting will make this boss fight easier to deal with. If one of your players doesn't have a defensive for the overlap (bomb with lightning debuff) use Blessing of Sacrifice immediately. If you get the overlap then bubble, make sure to rotate your own personals for the overlap if you get it multiple times Divine Protection, Aura Mastery or Bubble you can also ask for a slow fall to mitigate the fall damage (if you have a mage). [Soul Treads](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323609/soul-treads) these boots enchant will reduce your fall damage by 10%.

**The Manastorms:**

There's not really a lot to talk about cooldown whise on this boss, but if one of your players get targetet by Shadowfury and for some reasson dont have a defensiv available for the group wide AOE damage overlap, Blessing of Sacrifice him immediately to keep him from dying. If your tank getting overwhelmed by the debuff in phase two and starts dropping really low, you can use Blessing of Protection on him, but make sure hes aware your about to do it since he loses all threat from the boss.

Since pressing the bombs is a healer job on this fight, keybinding mouseover interact will help you a ton.

**Mueh'Zala:**

There's two ways to play this boss, you either one phase or you two phase it. If your group decides to one phase, you typically wanna hold your wings for the add. But this is not necessary if you two phase since you will have one extra dps on your side to help you kill the add. Other than that you wanna dispel one player on Cosmic Collapse, you can also use Aura Mastery on one to mitigate damage.

### **Sanguine Depths:**

**Kryxis:**

If you're a new holy paladin player you might find yourself having a hard time on this boss fight. You wan't too make sure to split your cooldowns and have something for every wave of orbs for example, Ashen + Wings for first wave, Aura Mastery + Holy Avenger for second wave and lastly Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice for third wave. If your group happens to have a more optimised composition like a Rogue and a Mage, you could Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice, Cloak and Ice Block one wave which will make the boss fight significantly easier. If your grp is not healthy before a Juggernaut Rush you can always use Blessing of Protection on the targeted target and let him solo soak.

**Executor Tarvold:**

The most important thing to do on this boss is thinking ahead of time and tracking your dps players damage cooldowns, also knowing when the dangerous Castigate and add overlap happens (first one will happen on the second add spawn) make sure the targeted player uses a immunity or if they don't have one, use Blessing of Sacrifice on them. You generally wan't to use Wings + Ashen Hallow at start of fight since you will have 10 stacks of the damage buff this will cover the first add no damage mitigation cooldowns should be used here. Second add would most likely be Bubble + Blessing of Sacrifice since its a overlap, Third add would be Holy Avenger + Aura Mastery.
