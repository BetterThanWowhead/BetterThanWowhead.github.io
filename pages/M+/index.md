# Overview

In this guide you'll find everything you need to know to become the Mona Lisa of Holy Paladins.

## What makes Holy Paladin a strong pick in m+ currently?
---
### **Damage.**

Our biggest strength is our ability to do big amounts of damage on command due to our strong cooldowns. Our cooldowns also give us insanely high priority damage, to the point where you can keep up with most dps in your group.

### **Healing within cooldowns.**

The healing we can do within our cooldown window. Which will allow your grp to pull more aggressively than they could with other healers.

### **Damage Reduction.**

Devotion Aura is a 3% passive DR and 15% on use, which is one of the strongest healer cooldowns in the game.

### **Utility.**

Paladin utility is one of the strongest and game changing one in the game when used correctly. We will talk more about this later on in the guide.

## Weaknesses.
---
### **Throughput outside of major cooldowns.**

Our biggest weakness is that we're too reliant on our cooldowns to carry us through difficult parts of the dungeons. The largest learning curves in dungeon healing as a paladin is learning how to manage your cooldowns properly.

### **Being a Melee Healer.**

Being a melee healer has historically been a weakness in dungeons, because mobs with a lot of frontals or range baitable mechanics.
