**Blood Death Knight**

When you are playing with a Blood DK you will notice that they are very self sustain and barely needs any healing. That being said, you still want to keep track of a few things on your party frames for example, Runic Power since this is where their self sustain lies and active mitigation like, Dancing Rune Weapon, Vampiric Blood, Rune Tap and Icebound Fortitude. Good usages of Blessing of Sacrifice is generally outside of Dancing Rune Weapon or other big active mitigation cooldowns or if you see the DK is going below 5 stacks of Bone Shield they are most likely in danger since this will cause them to lose the buff called Ossuary, this is generally a good time to use Blessing of Sacrifice or Aura Mastery to mitigate damage. You will find situations where using Blessing of Sacrifice while grouping mobs could be good aswell.

**Protection Paladin**

The most important things to track on your party framse while playing with a Protection Paladin is Shield of the Righteous, Arden Defender, Guardian of Ancient Kings and Divine Shield. Blessing of Sacrifice can be used start of a pull if the Paladin does not have Arden Defender or Guardian available/has to save Guardian for a upcoming pull, can also be used when he is dry and the pull are still healthy.

**Protection Warrior**

Warrior is the kind of tank that are able to self sustain himself most of the time but requires a little bit of healing every now and then. You should track Shield Block, Shield Wall, Last Stand and Ignore Pain on your frames. Keep in mind that you want to make sure to stand relatively close the the warrior without getting hit by frontals to allow him to Intervene you easily to get Shield Block uptime without getting hit in his back while doing so. Blessing of Sacrifice can be used whenever the warrior is dry (outside of Shield Wall/Trinket).

**Brewmaster Monk**

The most important things to track on your frames while playing with a Brew Monk is Celestial Brew, Fortifying Brew and Stagger (which is a debuff), Good Blessing of Sacrifice usages are generally later into the pull when the monk have used his defensive Trinket/Celestial Brew and are on his way to his second or third Celestial Brew usage. That being said, Blessing of Sacrifice can also be used on pull to group mobs up.

**Vengeance Demon Hunter**

DH is a great tank with Holy Paladin since we provide them with passive damage reduction and strong cooldowns like Aura Mastery or Blessing of Sacrifice to mitigate damage taken in their downtime. The things you want to make sure you are tracking on your frames is Metamorphosis, Fel Devastation, Fiery Brand and Demon Spikes. Whenever your Demon Hunter are setting up a pull without Metamorphosis you can use Blessing of Sacrifice or Aura Mastery to give him an easier time grouping mobs.

**Guardian Druid**

Druid is very straight forward tank to heal, but there is a few things you will have to track, the most important one is their Incarnation duration since this is what makes them immortals on big pulls and you generally never should have to heal or do anything to keep your tank alive during this, other than that Survival Instincts, Barkskin and Iron Fur stacks. Blessing of Sacrifice can be used while your tank is grouping mobs outside of Incarnation since this will make them have significantly lower rage generation which means they will have less Iron Fur stacks that being said, if they are using Survival Instincts Blessing of Sacrifice should not be necessary since this will make them take 50% less damage for 6 seconds duration.
