### **Stat priority**

You should always prioritizing Intellect during first few tiers of an expansion.This might change later onto the expansion.

Intellect > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery. 

### Haste

This is our strongest secondary because holy power generation. Thereâ€™s no breakpoints or softcaps stack it until mana becomes an issue.

### Versatility

Our second best stat because it gives us the highest Damage/Healing throughput also provides us with a solid amount of Damage Reduction.

### Critical Strike

Since we rarely use Infusion of Light procs, Critical Strike loses a lot of value but still provides a decent amount of Healing/damage throughput which puts it above Mastery.

### Mastery

Mastery is a good choice for raw healing. But it has no effect on our damage, the healing it contributes is also dependent on composition and positioning.

### Secondary Stat Diminishing Returns

In Shadowlands, now all secondary stats have multiple rating thresholds that reduce the effectiveness of additional rating for that specific secondary stat. This reduction begins to take effect once any rating provides an additional 30% of any stat (with the exception of mastery, for mastery, this is normalized with mastery points as mastery points give differing percentages of benefit depending on any given spec). The diminishing returns only affects *rating* specifically, no matter where it comes from, but it does not affect stat multipliers or effects that add a fixed amount of % to the stat.
