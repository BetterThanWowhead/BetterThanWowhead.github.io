### **Stat priority:**

Intellect > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery.

You should always prioritise Intellect during first few tiers of a expansion, this might change later into the expansion.

**Haste:**

is our strongest secondary because holy power generation. There’s no breakpoints or softcaps stack it until mana becomes a issue.

**Versatility:**

is our second best stat because it gives us the highest Damage/Healing throughput also provides us with a solid amount of Damage Reduction.

**Critical Strike:**

Since we rarely use Infusion of Light procs Critical Strike loses a lot of value but still provides a decent amount of Healing/damage throughput which putts it Above Mastery.

**Mastery:**

Mastery is still a decent choice for raw healing. But it has no effect on our damage, the healing it contributes is also dependent on composition and positioning.

### **Best Legendarys**

---

Mad Paragon will be your best legendary for Venthyr as it will greatly increase our damage we do inside Ashen Hallow.

Shock Barrier is our strongest healing legendary in m+ and are also passive, This would be your legendary if you wan’t more healing.
