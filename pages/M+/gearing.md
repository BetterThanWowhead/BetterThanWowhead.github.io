### **Stat priority**

Intellect > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery. 

That being said, if you are playing kyrian Crit value increases.

You should always prioritise Intellect during first few tiers of a expansion, this might change later into the expansion.

### Haste

This is our strongest secondary because holy power generation. Thereâ€™s no breakpoints or softcaps stack it until mana becomes an issue.

### Versatility

Our second best stat because it gives us the highest Damage/Healing throughput also provides us with a solid amount of Damage Reduction.

### Critical Strike

Since we rarely use Infusion of Light procs Critical Strike loses a lot of value but still provides a decent amount of Healing/damage throughput which puts it above Mastery.

### Mastery

Mastery is still a decent choice for raw healing. But it has no effect on our damage, the healing it contributes is also dependent on composition and positioning.

### Secondary Stat Diminishing Returns

In Shadowlands, now all secondary stats have multiple rating thresholds that reduce the effectiveness of additional rating for that specific secondary stat. This reduction begins to take effect once any rating provides an additional 30% of any stat (with the exception of mastery, for mastery, this is normalised with mastery points as mastery points give differing percentages of benefit depending on any given spec). The diminishing returns only affects *rating* specifically, no matter where it comes from, but it does not affect stat multipliers or effects that add a fixed amount of % to the stat. Rating thresholds are as follows for each secondary stat:

### Enchant and Gems

Ring:
[Tenet of Haste](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309617/tenet-of-haste) or [Tenet of Versatility](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309619/tenet-of-versatility) depending on your gear.

Chest:
[Eternal Stats](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=324773/eternal-stats) or [Eternal Bounds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323761/eternal-bounds) but this should not be necessary.

Weapon: [Celestial Guidance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309627/celestial-guidance).

Bracers: [Eternal Intellect](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309609/eternal-intellect).

Cloak: [Fortified Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309530/fortified-avoidance) or [Fortified Leech](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=309531/fortified-leech) you should enchant Fortified Leech until you reach the point when Avoidance can make you survive a one shot.

Boots: [Soul Treads](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323609/soul-treads) These boot enchant are useful for Dealer Xy'exa in De other Side.

Weapon Oil: [Shadowcore Weapon Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=171285/shadowcore-oil).

Armor Kit: [Heavy Desolate Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=172347/heavy-desolate-armor-kit).

Gems: [Quick Jewel Cluster](https://www.wowhead.com/item=173128/quick-jewel-cluster) or [Versatile Jewel Cluster](https://www.wowhead.com/item=173129/versatile-jewel-cluster) depending on your gear.

Speed Gem: [Straddling Sage Agate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=169220/straddling-sage-agate) there is absolutely zero reason to not wear one of these gems, this will potentially provide you with more damage than a 16 stat secondary gem, but also give you more time to move out of mechanics while focusing on other things on your screen, if you're not using one of these you are hard trolling.
