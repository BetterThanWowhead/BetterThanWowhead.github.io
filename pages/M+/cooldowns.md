The most important part to success in m+ is knowing how to play around your cooldowns, where and when to use them properly. I would suggest you to check out [Dungeons](/M+/dungeons) for more information about cooldown management in mythic+.

Our strongest cooldown, learning how to play around with this will make the biggest difference in your gameplay.

A very flexible cooldown can be used for either healing or damage if you're not in need of a extra throughput cooldown in between your Ashen Hallows.

This is one of the strongest healer cooldowns. And should NEVER be underestimated, this is your best tool to handle large incoming AoE damage spikes but could also be used for tank damage mitigation.

This will save you a ton of healing globals and should be used as frequently as possible on your tank whenever you don't have Avenging Wrath available.

#### <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=642" data-wh-icon-size="large"></a>

With <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=114154/unbreakable-spirit" data-wowhead="spell=114154"></a> talent Divine Shield is a 3.5min cooldown, and can be used many ways such as taunting tank hits or the most important to make AoE healing easier to deal with.

#### <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022/blessing-of-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=1022" data-wh-icon-size="large"></a>

Knowing when to use this will save you more keys then what you could imagine. This can be used to clear Necrotic stacks, immuning certain dangerous boss mechanics or debuffs, Blessing of Protection is an extremely strong cooldown.

Note: Blessing of Protection won't mitigate Blessing of Sacrifice damage taken unless its physical damage taken.
