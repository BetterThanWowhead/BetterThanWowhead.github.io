### Engineering

Since Blizzard gave Paladins a combat ress in Dragonflight being an Engineer is not as necessary as it used to be but it'll still provide you with a few meaningful items such as;

[Dimensional Shifter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310495/dimensional-shifter) is a belt enchant that will allow you to enter invisibility on a 2 minute cooldown but has a relatively high chance to backfire which will also putt your invisibility potion on a 20 seconds cooldown.

[50ul-Tr4p](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310493/50ul-tr4p) can be used for CCing things such as, the oozes on first or second boss Plaguefall. Keep in mind this is not a one time use item so you don't need to have multiple of these.
