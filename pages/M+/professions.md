### Engineering

Having this is a absolute must as Holy Paladin in mythic+ as it will provide you with a lot of meaningful things, but most importantly a combat ress.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310495/dimensional-shifter" data-wh-icon-size="medium" data-wowhead="item=310495"></a> this is a belt enchant that will allow you to invis on a 2 minute cooldown but has a relatively high chance to backfire which will also putt your Invisibility potion on a 20 seconds cooldown.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=310493/50ul-tr4p" data-wh-icon-size="medium" data-wowhead="item=310493"></a> this can be used for CCing things such as, the oozes on first or second boss Plaguefall. Keep in mind this is not a one time use item so you don't need to have multiple of these.
