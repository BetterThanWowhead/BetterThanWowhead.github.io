**Divine Toll:**

This is a 45 seconds cooldown (at best) with mikanikos as your soulbind and a very powerful healing or AoE damage cooldown that should be used as frequently as possible. You want to make sure that you use this on 0 holy power since it will generate 5 instantly.

**Summon Steward:**

This will not only activate the goliaths in Necrotic Wake or allow you to pick up the spears in Spires of Ascension but also provide you with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=177278/phial-of-serenity" data-wowhead="spell=177278"></a> this will clear a lot of dangerous debuffs i would suggest you to import a phial reminder from [Addons & WeakAuras](/M+/weakauras).

**Soulbind and Conduits:**

Your go to setup as kyrian should look something like this [Forgelite Prime Mikanikos](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/kyrian/forgelite-prime-mikanikos/paladin/AwaW6pYBBS1EChIFMPoKJTAQCiMVK2MKJSyqCjV2AAo), because we do not have 2x finesse as kyrian, you generally do not want to change to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> since we do not have Door of Shadows as kyrian, which makes <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339268/lights-barding" data-wowhead="spell=339268"></a> more important than ever.

**Best Legendaries:**

Note: All these legendaries should be crafted with Haste and Versatility if you are a mythic+ focused player.

Crafting Priority:

1. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337638/vanguards-momentum" data-wowhead="spell=355100"></a> this should be your number one priority since this will greatly increase our damage.

2. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355098/divine-resonance" data-wowhead="spell=355098"></a> kyrian paladins covenant legendary are very underwhelming, but since we're forced to wear one covenant legendarie and only one random this will be your number two priority.

Note: If you cast Divine Toll and target something for example in the maze of Mists of Tirna Scithe you can actually pull that target through the wall with the Divine Resonance Holy Shock proc.

3. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337825/shock-barrier" data-wowhead="spell=337825"></a> since we have Divine Toll and are playing Crusader's Might this legendary synergises very well and will provide a meaningful amount of healing throughout your key.
