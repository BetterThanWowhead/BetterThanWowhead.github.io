Keep in mind that there is a tiny window inbetween your Divine Toll and your <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=340218/ringing-clarity" data-wowhead="spell=340218"></a> Holy Shock procs, which means the moment you press Divine Toll you can instantly spend holy power on Shield of the Righteous and gain 2-3 extra holy power.
