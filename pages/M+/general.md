## Strengths

### Damage within cooldowns

Paladins biggest strength is our ability to do huge amounts of priority target damage.

### Healing within cooldowns

The healing we can do within CDs, which will allow your group to pull more aggressively than they could with other healers.

### Damage Reduction

Devotion Aura is a 3% passive DR and 15% on use, which is one of the strongest healer cooldowns in the game.

### Utility

Paladins utility is one of the strongest in mythic+ when used correctly.

## Weaknesses

### Throughput outside of major cooldowns

Holy Paladins biggest weakness is that we are very reliant on our cooldowns to carry us through dangerous parts of the dungeons. The largest learning curves in healing as a Paladin is learning how to play around your cooldowns.

### Being a Melee Healer

Being a melee healer has historically been a weakness in dungeons, because mobs with a lot of frontals or range baitable mechanics.
