## Strengths

---

**Damage.**

Paladins biggest strength is our ability to do big amounts of damage on command. Our cooldowns also give us insanely high priority damage.

**Healing within cooldowns.**

The healing we can do within our cooldown window. Which will allow your grp to pull more aggressively than they could with other healers.

**Damage Reduction.**

Devotion Aura is a 3% passive DR and 15% on use, which is one of the strongest healer cooldowns in the game.

**Utility.**

Paladin brings insanely strong and game changing utility when used correctly.

## Weaknesses

---

**Throughput outside of major cooldowns.**

Holy Paladins biggest weakness is that we're too reliant on our cooldowns to carry us through difficult parts of the dungeons. The largest learning curves in dungeon healing as a paladin is learning how to manage your cooldowns properly.

**Being a Melee Healer.**

Being a melee healer has historically been a weakness in dungeons, because mobs with a lot of frontals or range baitable mechanics.
