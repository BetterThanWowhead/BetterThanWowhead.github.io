---
This is a very flexible and strong priority target damage ability, this should generally be used to force proc Avenging Wrath to make AoE healing situations easier to deal with or if there is no healing required for the next 30 seconds then use it on cooldown.

### <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=324631/fleshcraft" data-wowhead="spell=324631"></a>

---
A very powerful defensive CD on 2 minutes cooldown. This will also provide you with meaningful buffs for your entire group when you are channeling it close to nearby Pestilence Slime, Congealed Slime or Rotmarrow Slimes in Plaguefall.

### Soulbind & Conduits

---
Your soulbind setup as Necrolord should look like this: [Plague Deviser Marileth](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/necrolord/plague-deviser-marileth/paladin/Awa-5r4CBS1ECiUtdAoSFTDgCiUwEAoiFStjCiUsqgo) or [Emeni](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/necrolord/emeni/paladin/AwaW6r4CBS1ECiUtdAoSBTDgCiUwEAoiFSyqCiUrYwo) for Explosive/Spitefull weeks. You can change 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339316/echoing-blessings" data-wowhead="spell=339316"></a> for 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> when you are playing Mists of Tirna Scithe because this will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. Playing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall will help you a ton since there is a lot of mobs you have/can use Turn Evil on and this conduit will reduce the cast timer by a large amount.

### Legendaries

---
These legendaries should be crafted with Haste and Versatility if you are focusing on mythic+.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355099/duty-bound-gavel" data-wowhead="spell=355099"></a>  is a very powerful legendary while being our covenant one, this will greatly increase Necrolord's overall throughput.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337594/the-mad-paragon" data-wowhead="spell=337594"></a> will be your go to legendary in mythic+ since it will increase the damage you deal throughout your dungeon significantly.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337825/shock-barrier" data-wowhead="spell=337825"></a> is a good option if you feel like you are in need of more healing throughput. That being said, the healing Shock Barrier provides wont make a big difference since we don't have Divine Toll or play Crusader's Might as Necrolord.
