This is a very flexible and powerful ability on a short cooldown that will instantly generate you 5 holy power and are by far your best tool to deal with AoE healing, make sure that you are on 0 holy power before using this. Keep in mind that there is a tiny window inbetween your Divine Toll and your <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=340218/ringing-clarity" data-wowhead="spell=340218"></a> Holy Shock procs, which means the moment you press Divine Toll you can instantly spend holy power on Shield of the Righteous and gain 2-3 extra holy power.

This will not only activate the goliaths in Necrotic Wake or allow you to pick up the spears in Spires of Ascension but also provides you with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=177278/phial-of-serenity" data-wowhead="spell=177278"></a> which will clear a lot of dangerous debuffs, i would suggest you to import a phial reminder from [Addons & WeakAuras](/M+/weakauras).

### Soulbind & Conduits

Your go to setup as Kyrian should look like this: [Forgelite Prime Mikanikos](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/kyrian/forgelite-prime-mikanikos/paladin/AwaW6pYBBS1EChIFMPoKJTAQCiMVK2MKJSyqCjV2AAo). Because we do not have two finesse slots as Kyrian, you generally don't want to change to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> since we don't have Door of Shadows or Soulshape, which makes <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339268/lights-barding" data-wowhead="spell=339268"></a> more important than ever.

### Legendaries

---
These legendaries should be crafted with Haste and Versatility if you are focusing on mythic+.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355098/divine-resonance" data-wowhead="spell=355098"></a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337638/vanguards-momentum" data-wowhead="spell=355100"></a> this should be your go to build as Kyrian in mythic+ since it will increase the burst damage you deal with Divine Toll significantly. Keep in mind that 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337825/shock-barrier" data-wowhead="spell=337825"></a> is still a incredibly strong healing throughput choice.

### Divine Resonance

---
You can actually pull throught walls in the maze of Mists of Tirna Scithe, if you cast Divine Toll and after target whatever you want to pull while wearing Divine Resonance.
