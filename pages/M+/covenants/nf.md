While you're playing this you'll feel that these buffs are mostly very undertuned and you will notice the lack of healing throughput outside of Avenging Wrath. That being said there is currently a bug that makes Blessing of Summer have a 80% chance to do 60% extra damage instead of 40% chance which makes it an incredibly strong damage cooldown on 3 minutes. 

You will not see any play of Night Fae in higher than the average keys for the reasons mentioned above but it could potentially be good with a very specific comp in a MDI situation or for damage log runs for fun.

It will rotate in the following order on a 45 seconds cooldown:

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328620/blessing-of-summer" data-wowhead="spell=328620"></a>: blesses an ally causing their attacks to have an additional chance to deal holy damage.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328622/blessing-of-autumn" data-wowhead="spell=32862"></a>: blesses an ally causing their cooldowns to recover 30% faster for the duration of the buff.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328281/blessing-of-winter" data-wowhead="spell=328281"></a>: blesses an ally causing their attacks to deal additional damage and apply a movement and attack speed stacking debuff.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328282/blessing-of-spring" data-wowhead="spell=328282"></a>: blesses an ally with 10% increased healing done and 20% healing received.

Here you can see the best targets to use [Blessing of Summer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TpJwONNo-CBkJRd9KzTNwvBW9MzIHmPoddZjKWOO1do/edit?usp=sharing) on. (in construction)

### Soulbind & Conduits

---
Your soulbind setup as Night Fae should look like this: [Korayn](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/korayn/paladin/AwaW6r4CBS1ECiUtdAoSBTDZCiUwEAoiFStjCiUsqgo). If you would ever decide to play this in keys you can change 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339316/echoing-blessings" data-wowhead="spell=339316"></a> for 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> whenever you are playing Mists of Tirna Scithe because this will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. Playing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall will help you a ton since there is a lot of mobs you have/can use Turn Evil on and this conduit will reduce the cast timer by a large amount.

### Legendaries

---
These legendaries should be crafted with Haste and Versatility if you are focusing on mythic+.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355100/seasons-of-plenty" data-wowhead="spell=355100"></a> this is the main reason Night Fae is viable in the first place, this will empower all of Night Fae's blessings but most importantly, Blessing of Summer.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337594/the-mad-paragon" data-wowhead="spell=337594"></a> will be your go to legendary in mythic+ since it will increase the damage you deal throughout your dungeon significantly.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337825/shock-barrier" data-wowhead="spell=337825"></a> is a solid healing option since we're playing Crusader's Might as Night Fae.
