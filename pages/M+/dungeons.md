The key to managing your cooldowns in a m+ dungeon is knowing the route and the dangerous parts of the dungeon. The biggest thing you wan't to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns. So if you use Avenging Wrath you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Divine Shield if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in the dungeons.
