A very powerful healing and damage cooldown, this might be hard to get value out of in pug groups since you have to pull very aggressively around this whenever it's available.

**Soulbind & Conduits:**

Your go to soulbind should be Theotar since its the highest damage soulbind for your entire grp because Wasteland Propriety also it gives you 3% tea that will either give you Intellect, Haste, Vers or crit.

Your setup should look something like this [Theotar Soulbind](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/theotar-the-mad-duke/paladin/Awa-774CBS1ECBUtdAgSBTD0CCUwEAgiFStjCDUsqgg). You should change 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339316/echoing-blessings" data-wowhead="spell=339316"></a> for 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> when you are playing Mists of Tirna Scithe because this will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. Playing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall will help you a ton since there is a lot of mobs you have/can use Turn Evil on and this conduit will reduce the cast timer by a large amount.

General Draven should generally only be played if it would allow you surviving a one shot or if you're pugging 24+ keys. Keep in mind that you are losing out on a noticable amount of group damage by playing Draven instead of Theotar.

Your setup should look something like this [General Draven Soulbind](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/general-draven/paladin/Awa-b5YDBS10ChUtRAolLVwKEgUwEAolMPQKIRUrYwo), dont forget to cast Door of Shadows if you need the absorb to prevent a one shot.
