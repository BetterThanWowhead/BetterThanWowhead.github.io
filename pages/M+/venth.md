**<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316958/ashen-hallow" data-wowhead="spell=316958"></a>:**

A very powerful healing and damage cooldown that will allow your group to do pulls they would not been able to do with other healers. Keep in mind this might be hard to get value out of in pug group since you will be forced to pull very aggressively around this whenever it's available.

**Soulbind & Conduits:**

Your go to soulbind should be Theotar since its the highest damage soulbind for your entire grp because Wasteland Propriety also it gives you 3% tea that will either give you Intellect, Haste, Vers or crit.

Your setup should look like this [Theotar Soulbind](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/theotar-the-mad-duke/paladin/Awa-774CBS1ECBUtdAgSBTD0CCUwEAgiFStjCDUsqgg). You can change 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339316/echoing-blessings" data-wowhead="spell=339316"></a> for 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> when you are playing Mists of Tirna Scithe because this will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. Playing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall will help you a ton since there is a lot of mobs you have/can use Turn Evil on and this conduit will reduce the cast timer by a large amount.

General Draven should generally only be played if it would allow you surviving a one shot or if you're pugging 24+ keys. Keep in mind that you are losing out on a noticable amount of group damage by playing Draven instead of Theotar.

Your setup should look something like this [General Draven Soulbind](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/general-draven/paladin/Awa-b5YDBS10ChUtRAolLVwKEgUwEAolMPQKIRUrYwo), dont forget to cast Door of Shadows if you need the absorb to prevent a one shot.

**Legendaries:**

These legendaries should be crafted with Haste and Versatility if you're focusing on mythic+.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355447/radiant-embers" data-wowhead="spell=355447"></a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337594/the-mad-paragon" data-wowhead="spell=337594"></a> will be your go to build since it will greatly increase the damage you deal inside Ashen Hallow. You could also replace Mad Paragon with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337825/shock-barrier" data-wowhead="spell=337825"></a> if you feel like you are in need of more healing throughput. That being said, the healing Shock Barrier provides wont make a big difference since we dont have Divine Toll as Venthyr.
