<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=320966/overhead-slash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=320966" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

There's absolutely zero healing requirement on this fight (assuming your group are not standing in the line). Focus your cooldowns on doing damage and if your tank is not full health before a Overhead Slash, Blessing of Sacrifice him immediately.

### Ventunax

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=324148/dark-stride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=324148" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard ticking debuff for 15 seconds that can only be applyd to ranges unless full melee group.

One of your players will get targeted by Dark Stride and this will apply a hard ticking debuff, make sure to rotate Blessing of Sacrifice, Aura Mastery and Blessing of Protection whenever your dps doesn't have a defensive available and when you're not inside Avenging Wrath or Holy Avenger.

### Oryphrion

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323195/purifying-blast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=323195" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard ticking debuff.

This fight is pretty much the same as Ventunax make sure to rotate your cooldowns whenever your dps does not have a defensive for the Purifying Blast, keep in mind Blessing of Protection also works on this mechanic for whatever reason. Blessing of Freedom will immune the Charged Stomp damage but you still have to dispel your tank afterwards. Lastly you should hold Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath for the damage increase phase to maximize the damage you can deal.

### Devos

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=334625/abyssal-detonation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=323195" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide large additional damage (stand in shield).

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=322818/lost-confidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=322818" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard ticking debuff that will leave a pool when dispelled or when the duration is over.

The most important part of this fight is prioritizing defensives, for example let's say you have a monk, you want to make sure to let him use Diffuse Magic on the Lost Confident debuff and instead dispel your second target's debuff because the Diffuse Magic will reflect the debuff to the boss and deal a ton of damage. Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath can be used either after the first intermission or the second. Make sure to use Blessing of Sacrifice if someone is not full health before an Abyssal Detonation or Aura Mastery to mitigate the damage taken.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Forsworn Castigator's Forsworn Doctrine:** Make sure to use Hammer of Justice on this cast because you generally never want to use kicks on it and instead save interrupts for the Dark Lash, You can also use Blinding Light on the Dark Lash casts if all interrupts are on cooldown.

**Forsworn Mender's Imbue Weapon:** Make sure to Arcane Torrent and pick up the weapon that will get thrown afterwards on the ground.

**Forsworn Skirmisher's Hurl:** If they jump away or your tank starts to kite randomly, make sure to use Hammer of Justice, Blinding Light or Blessing of Protection to mitigate damage.

**Forsworn Stealthclaw:** Using Blessing of Protection when your tank is grouping these mobs will make it significantly easier for him because it will prevent him from getting stunned when they leave stealth.

**Klotos:** This is the hardest mob in the game, make sure to have Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath available for this, when Ashen Hallow is about to end you can use Aura Mastery or Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice if it's still healthy.
