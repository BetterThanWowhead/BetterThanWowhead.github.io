### Kin-Tara

There's absolutly zero healing requirement on this fight (assuming your group are not standing in the line). Focus your cooldowns on doing damage and if your tank is not full health before a Overhead Slash, Blessing of Sacrifice him immediately.

### Ventunax

One of your range dps will get targeted by Dark Stride and this will apply a hard ticking debuff for 15 seconds, make sure to rotate Blessing of Sacrifice, Aura Mastery and Blessing of Protection whenever your dps doesn't have a defensive and when you're not inside Avenging Wrath.

### Oryphrion

This fight is basically the same as Ventunax make sure to rotate your cooldowns whenever your dps does not have a defensive for the Purifying Blast, keep in mind Blessing of Protection also works on this mechanic for whatever reason. Blessing of Freedom will immune the Charged Stomp damage but you still have to dispel your tank afterwards. And lastly you should try to hold Avenging Wrath + Ashen Hallow for the damage increase phase to maximize your dps to the boss.

### Devos

The most important part of this fight is prioritising defensives, for example let's say you have a monk you want to make sure to let him use Diffuse Magic on the Lost Confident debuff and instead dispel your second target's debuff because the Diffuse Magic will reflect the debuff to the boss and deal a ton of damage. Make sure to use Blessing of Sacrifice if someone is not full health before a Abyssal Detonation or Aura Mastery to mitigate the damage.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Forsworn Castigator's Forsworn Doctrine:** Make sure to use Hammer of Justice on this cast because you generally never want to use kicks on it and instead use interrupts for the Dark Lash, You can also Blinding Light the Dark Lash cast if the interrupts are on cooldown.

**Forsworn Mender's Imbue Weapon:** Make sure to Arcane Torrent and pick up the weapon that will get thrown afterwards on the ground.

**Forsworn Skirmisher's Hurl:** If they jump away or your tank starts to kite, make sure to use Hammer of Justice, Blinding Light or Blessing of Protection to mitigate damage.

**Forsworn Stealthclaw:** Using Blessing of Protection when your tank is grouping the mobs will make it significantly easier for him because Blessing of Protection prevent him from getting stunned when they leave stealth.

**Klotos:** This is the hardest mob in the game, make sure to have every cooldown available for this.
