### Affront of Challengers

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333292/searing-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=333292" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard ticking 12 seconds debuff that should be interrupted.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=320069/mortal-strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=320069" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Reduces tanks healing received by 30% for 10 seconds.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=333540/opportunity-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=333540" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Use Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light to stop this.

This boss should have a very minimal healing requirement (assuming Searing Death is interrupted) so you should focus your cooldowns on damage here, keep in mind to cast your Hammer of Wraths into Dessia. If your tank is getting overwhelmed you can Divine Shield or Blessing of Protection + Taunt one mortal strike to make him able to stabilize easier.

### Xav the Unfallen

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=320050/might-of-maldraxxus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=320050" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large group-wide damage hit.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=320644/brutal-combo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=320644" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

This is a great fight for Holy Paladin especially if you skip banners since Blessing of Freedom will clear the slow effect. You want to make sure to have a personal for every Might of Maldraxxus since the damage will start to one shot you on a higher key level. Keep in mind that you don't necessarily have to top your dps players after every Might of Maldraxxus since they will get full healed from the chain when they get thrown down to the duel.

### Kul'tharok

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319626/phantasmal-parasite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319626" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard ticking debuff that will go on two players at a time.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319521/draw-soul" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319521" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Two huge ticks of damage on two players.

This fight is all about dispel management, make sure to prioritize dispelling squishy dps players or people without defensives available. Generally if you have a Windwalker Monk in your group make sure to let him Diffuse Magic and if your tank gets the debuff never dispel him and instead dispel the other player. Make sure you use Aura Mastery on one of the Grasping Hands + debuff overlap, keep in mind Warriors can Spell Reflect every Grasping Hand so you might not necessarily want to use Aura Mastery if a Warrior gets targeted.

### Gorechop

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323515/hateful-strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=323515" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

Everything on this fight is physical damage which means Blessing of Protection will work on both the Hateful Strike and if someone would get hit by the chains. Make sure if your tank is not full health before a Hateful Strike, use Blessing of Sacrifice or Aura Mastery to mitigate the damage, you can also Divine Shield or Blessing of Protection taunt right before to soak the hit and if you're brave you can Shield of the Righteous + Divine Protection and taunt aswell but make sure your tank is aware that you're about to it.

### Mord'retha, the Endless Empress 

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339573/echoes-of-carnage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=339573" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide large additional hit. 

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=324079/reaping-scythe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=324079" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

You will see most groups using lust in p2 (at 50% health) to burn the boss since there's more dangerous mechanics happening from there on. I would suggest you to use Aura Mastery on Echoes of Carnage which the boss will cast when you hit 50% health. Make sure to use Blessing of Sacrifice if your tank is not full health before a Reaping Scythe.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Putrid Butcher's Devour Flesh:** Very important that you use Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light the Devour Flesh cast to prevent him from killing your tank and healing himself.

**Rancid Gasbag:** If your group for some reason would decide to pull this mob, make sure too rotate your cooldows for example start with Avenging Wrath and at the end of the duration use Aura Mastery or Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice.

**Shackled Soul:** These are very hard hitting especially if your group are not using any AoE stops or stuns, you can use Aura Mastery + Holy Avenger here to make it easier to deal with. Make sure to use Blessing of Freedom on your tank while hes grouping these up.

**Portal Guardian's Soul Storm:** This mob will cast an ability called Soul Storm every 22 seconds ish, make sure to have Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath up for the first Portal Guardian mob, the second one you should have Avenging Wrath back up you can also use Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice or Aura Mastery to mitigate damage taken.

**Bone Magus Bone Spear:** If you notice that your group are out of interrupts make sure to use Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light to avoid deaths.

**Maniacal Soulbinder:** You generally want to dispel the first debuff this mob does (it is not a cast) and afterwards Hammer of Justice to delay the next one since you will not have dispel available instantly, doing this will mitigate a lot of damage taken.

**Shambling Arbalest's Jagged Quarrel:** Every now and then this mob will cast Jagged Quarrel which is a hard ticking DoT, make sure to use Hammer of Justice frequently and don't hesitate to use Blessing of Protection.

**Advent Nevermore:** If you happen to get Nevermore as your third mini boss, be aware that he will do a Ricocheting Blade into Seismic Stomp combo, if your dps did not line of sight the blade they will most likely get one shot if you don't use Blessing of Sacrifice on them before the stomp. Keep in mind that Blessing of Protection will fully immune both the bleed and the stomp.
