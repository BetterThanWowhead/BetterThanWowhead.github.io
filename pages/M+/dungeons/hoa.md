### Halkias

After 4 Glass Shards have spawned on the ground he will cast Refracted Sinlight, which means the tank will most likely move away to give people enough space before the Refracted Sinlight happens, make sure to wait a bit before casting your Ashen Hallow if you get it back from cooldown during the fight, so he does not accidentally move out of it.

### Echelon

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319733/stone-call" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319733" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - 6 adds that will cast Villainous Bolt.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319703/blood-torrent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319703" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Try to bait this outside of middle.

On this fight its important to rotate your cooldowns for every wave of adds, use Blinding Light to mass interrupt the Villainous Bolt to mitigate tank damage. Make sure to have either Divine Steed or Door of Shadows available if you would get targeted by the Stone Shattering Leap. If you see a player get targeted by Shattering Leap and has not received a decurse, Blessing of Protection him immediately to prevent him from getting stunned and make him able to dodge the leap.

### High Adjudicator Aleez

This boss has zero healing requirement (assuming your group interrupts the Volley of Power), so try do as much damage as you possibly can.

### Lord Chamberlain

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328791/ritual-of-woe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=328791" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Soak from statues you can position yourself middle of the boss and soak two.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323437/stigma-of-pride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=323437" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Huge ticking tank debuff every 3 sec over 18 seconds that increases by 30% every tick.

On this boss with a coordinated group and with any sort of immunity specs, you preferably do not want to soak the Ritual of Woe with your Divine Shield because taunting the Stigma of Pride debuff that will apply to the tank will mitigate a lot more damage and will make it a ton easier for your tank. Whenever you do not have Avenging Wrath (and assuming tank doesn't have any major cooldowns available), you can Blessing of Sacrifice the tank to mitigate damage.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Shard of Halkias Thrash:** You should rotate damage mitigation cooldowns whenever you do not have Avenging Wrath or Holy Avenger available, keep in mind Blessing of Protection will immune this ability.

**Depraved Collector's Collect Sins:** Letting this cast go fully through is useful for funnel damage in current meta, but if your tank is kiting and this mob is still alive he will cast Collect Sins on the nearest target and most likely kill him, if you see this is about to happen use Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light immediately.

**Depraved Houndmaster's Loyal Beast:** This will increase Vicious Gargron's damage done by 125% make sure to Hammer of Justice this.

**Depraved Obliterator's Curse of Obliteration:** This should generally never be interrupted and instead decursed but if you only have one decurse player in your group make sure to Blinding Light it if there's more than one of them, this will make them not recast it and instead cast the Wicked Bolt.

**Inquisitor Sigar:** The adds in this room will fixate random players, Blessing of Protection will fully immune all this damage.
