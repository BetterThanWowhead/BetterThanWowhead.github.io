### Ingra Maloch

Only thing to be aware of on this fight is the Dark Shroud debuff, it starts ticking very hard on a high tyrannical and can be difficult to deal with. How you can make this easier is to hold Holy Avenger + Aura Mastery for the second phase one and let Ashen Hallow cover in first phase, make sure to not use it to early since you want it for the 15 seconds boss burn aswell.

### Mistcaller

Since there's no healing requirement during the main boss phase you want to focus as much as possible damaging the boss and during the add phase you can rotate Holy Avenger, Aura Mastery and lastly Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice.

### Tred'ova

Only thing that really does any damage on this boss is not breaking the Mind Link, if you get targeted by this make sure to Door of Shadow or Divine Steed away from your group. The melee's from the small adds start to hurt quite a bit the higher you go using Blessing of Protection will immune all the damage.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Drust Spiteclaw's Bloodletting:** Blessing of Protection will fully immune all the damage from this debuff.

**Drust Harvester's Harvest Essence:** This ability should not be interrupted but instead CCd with Blinding Light, Leg Sweep etc, because you can't afford Spirit Bolt casts going through on a high fortified key.

**Drust Soulcleaver's Hand of Thros:** When they use this ability you want to make sure to Hammer of Justice one of these to prevent them from healing and making it a lot easier for your tank to handle.

**Drust Boughbreaker's Furious Thrashing:** Blessing of Protection will fully immune the damage from this mechanic, keep in mind these are also outrangable.

**Mistveil Stalker's Mistveil Bite:** Make sure to rotate Blinding Light and Hammer of Justice on these casts to prevent one shots.

**Mistveil Guardian's Bucking Rampage:** When these mobs start casting it make sure to Blinding Light or Hammer of Justice to prevent your group from having to run out of melee.

**Spinemaw Acidgullet's Volatile Acid:** This is not necessarily super important, but using Hammer of Justice on this will mitigate a lot of damage you would have to heal.
