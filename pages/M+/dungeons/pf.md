### Globgrog

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=324527/plaguestomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=324527" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide hard additional hit & leaves a debuff for 20 seconds.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=324459/beckon-slime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=324459" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hammer of Justice, Blinding Light and Turn Evil works on this.

Healing this boss is very simple, you wanna prioritize using your dispel on the most squishy player in your group and when your dispel comes back off from the cooldown, you can dispel whoever is in most danger. If someone is not topped before a Plaguestomp you can use either use Aura Mastery or Blessing of Sacrifice to keep them alive. Keep in mind that Blessing of Protection will fully immune and prevent the knock back from the Plaguestomp.

### Doctor ickus

Only thing you have to do on this fight is using dispel on the Slime Injection. I would suggest using Ashen Hallow on the last platform to skip the bomb completely and instead killing the boss if your group is somewhat coordinated, if not you can use whenever your group does not have a lot of damage. Using Turn Evil on the purple ozee will save you a ton of time since you can ignore killing it completely and keep it CC'd for the rest of the fight. (the ozee will spawn every time he jumps to a new platform).

### Domina Venomblade

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=325245/shadow-ambush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=325245" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large additional hit & stuns players in the circle.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=332313/brood-assassins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=325245" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Adds.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=325552/cytotoxic-slash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=325552" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Dispel.

The most dangerous thing on this boss to be aware of is getting multiple Shadow Ambushes in a row, if you are very unlucky you can get 4-5 in a row and its important that you are not using your Divine Protection or Divine Shield randomly. If this happens you want to Divine Protection the first one, you can either Divine Shield or Aura Mastery on the second Shadow Ambush, I personally prefer to use Divine Shield for damage, the third one would be Divine Protection again and lastly Aura Mastery. When the boss summons Brood Assasins and you do not have any throughput cooldowns, you can use Blessing of Sacrifice on the tank (assuming he doesn't have any active mitigation cooldowns).

### Margrave Stradama

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=322232/infectious-rain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=322232" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide large additional hit channel & applys a stacking debuff.

Healing this fight can be very difficult, so its important that you play well with your cooldowns and always think ahead what cooldowns you will use on on the next Acid Rain. Depending on your group composition you will either use Ashen Hallow in phase two or phase three, usually if you don't play with a boomkin you can use it in phase two. This means you would Holy Avenger on the first Acid Rain, the second rain would be Aura Mastery (this is hopefully the last rain in phase one). Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath should cover the second phase and no defensive cooldowns should be used here. In phase three the first rain would be Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice and the second rain you should have Holy Avenger back up. You want to dispel your most squishy dps on 2 stacks, this way you get to dispel twice and will mitigate the most damage. 

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Rigged Plagueborer's Wretched Phlegm:** Using freedom BEFORE the cast is finished will fully immune the damage, and can be used on every second Plagueborer cast.

**Slime Tentacle's Crushing Embrace:** Every now and then the tentacle will grip one of your players, you can either Hammer of Justice, Blinding Light, Freedom or use Blessing of Protection to break them free.

**Plaguebinder's Gripping Infection:** You need to use Freedom on this because you don't want to use your dispel on this mechanic since you need to save it for the debuff the Slimeclaws apply to your tank or closest target.

**Defender of Many Eyes Bulwark of Maldraxxus:** Using Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light on this is very important because it will reduce all mobs in the zones damage taken by 90%.

**Brood Ambusher Stealthlings:** If you see the casts is about to go through use Blinding Light or if you don't have it available, Blessing of Protection your squishiest player immediately.

**Congealed Slime's Withering Filth:** Use Hammer of Justice, Turn Evil or Blinding Light to prevent this cast.
