### Kryxis

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319685/severing-smash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319685" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide AoE damage that will knock you back and spawn 5 orbs that has to be soaked or kited.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319713/juggernaut-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319713" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Charge that need to be soaked or immuned.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=319650/vicious-headbutt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=319650" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

If you're a new Holy Paladin you might find yourself having a hard time on this boss fight. You want to make sure to split your cooldowns and have something for every wave of orbs for example, Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath for first wave, Aura Mastery + Holy Avenger for second wave and lastly Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice for third wave. If your group happens to have a more optimized composition like a Rogue and a Mage, you could Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice if you have a player without a immunity, Cloak of Shadows and Ice Block one wave which will make the boss fight significantly easier. If your group happens to not be healthy before a Juggernaut Rush, you can always use Blessing of Protection to allow him to solo soak.

The weapon <a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=189754/genesis-lathe?bonus=6805&msclkid=f0a746cda9e411ecbf54a35361f816a8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="item=189754" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> is actually not completely useless since you can weapon swap during your key. The idea is to equip Genesis Lathe before Kryxis and it will allow you to solo soak one or more Juggernaut Rush depending on key level. If you combine the Genesis Lathe 11-13k absorb, (cast Flash of Light on 90%+ health) then pool holy power for Shield of the Righteous and press your Divine Protection. This will mitigate more than enough damage to solo soak without an immunity. Keep in mind you can weapon swap back to your secondary stat weapon during the encounter aswell.

### Executor Tarvold

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=322554/castigate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=322554" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard hitting channel on random player.

The most important thing to do on this boss is thinking ahead of time and tracking your dps players damage cooldowns, also knowing when the dangerous Castigate and add overlap happens (first one will happen on the second add spawn and the hopefully last one will be on the forth add) make sure the targeted player uses a immunity or if they don't have one, use Blessing of Sacrifice on them. You generally want to use Avenging Wrath + Ashen Hallow at start of fight since you will have 10 stacks of the damage buff. This will cover the first add, no damage mitigation cooldowns should be used here. Second add would most likely be Divine Shield or Blessing of Sacrifice since its a overlap, third add would be Holy Avenger + Aura Mastery depending if your group have damage available or not (if they do) then save Holy Avenger for the Forth.

### Grand Proctor Beryllia

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=325360/rite-of-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=325360" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Collect orbs.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=326039/endless-torment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=326039" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide AoE damage. 

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=325254/iron-spikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=325254" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

Collecting orbs good and rotating immunities is the thing that will make the biggest difference on this boss. You ideally want to use Aura Mastery on the first Rite of Supremacy late to have the damage reduction rolling for the Endless Torment aswell, the second Endless Torment you would use Holy Avenger, third is Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice on your most squishy dps and lastly Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath. This being said you can still use Avenging Wrath on pull and have it back up for the forth Endless Torment also depending on your group composition and route you might have to play differently.

### General Kaal

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=323845/wicked-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=323845" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Hard additional hit on two players & apply a ticking debuff (unless dodged).

This fight is pretty straight forward, you can avoid getting the bleed by using Door of Shadows or Divine Steed. If you see a player is about to get 2 stacks of the debuff you can use Blessing of Protection to clear and immune the charge hit. Keep in mind that the shield clears all bleeds so you ideally do not want to use any sort of immunity before Gloom Squall.

Note: while you're fighting Kaal in the gauntlet make sure that you are not standing on top of someone whenever he's about to jump.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Chamber Sentinel's Severing Slice:** This is the frontal the sentinel does, if one of your players gets hit meanwhile your tank are kiting, Blessing of Protection will fully immune it. You can also soak the bleed intentionally to help your tank (but make sure he's aware you're about to do it).

**Research Scribe's Throw Research:** This mob will stand still and cast books on random players, and the damage will scale really high the higher the key level is. Make sure to use Blessing of Protection to immune damage and Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light to delay the casts.

**Grand Overseer's Dread Bindings:** You can pre cast Freedom on this mechanic and you won't have to run out to break the chain.

**Depths Warden's Barbed Shackles:** This ability should be interrupted but if it would happen to go through use Freedom immediately.

**Dark Acolyte's Dark Bolt:** This cast becomes very dangerous the higher you go, use Blinding Light to mass interrupt the casts.

**Wicked Oppressor's Wrack Soul:** Use Hammer of Justice on this cast to mitigate damage if you don't have dispel available.

**Gluttonous Tick's Drain Essence:** Blinding Light and Hammer of Justice should be used frequently on these mobs whenever your group does not have interrupts available.
