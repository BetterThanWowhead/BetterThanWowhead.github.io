**Kryxis:**

If you're a new holy paladin player you might find yourself having a hard time on this boss fight. You wan't to make sure to split your cooldowns and have something for every wave of orbs for example, Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath for first wave, Aura Mastery + Holy Avenger for second wave and lastly Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice for third wave. If your group happens to have a more optimised composition like a Rogue and a Mage, you could Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice if you have a player without a immunity, Cloak of Shadows and Ice Block one wave which will make the boss fight significantly easier. If your group happends to not be healthy before a Juggernaut Rush, you can always use Blessing of Protection to allow him to solo soak.

**Executor Tarvold:**

The most important thing to do on this boss is thinking ahead of time and tracking your dps players damage cooldowns, also knowing when the dangerous Castigate and add overlap happens (first one will happen on the second add spawn) make sure the targeted player uses a immunity or if they don't have one, use Blessing of Sacrifice on them. You generally wan't to use Avenging Wrath + Ashen Hallow at start of fight since you will have 10 stacks of the damage buff. This will cover the first add, no damage mitigation cooldowns should be used here. Second add would most likely be Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice since its a overlap, Third add would be Holy Avenger + Aura Mastery.

**Grand Proctor Beryllia:**

Collecting orbs good and rotating immunities is the thing that will make the biggest difference on this boss. You ideally want to use Aura Mastery on the first Rite of Supremacy late to have the damage reduction rolling for the Endless Torment aswell, the second Endless Torment you would use Holy Avenger, third is Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice on your most squishy dps and lastly Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath. This being said you can still use Avenging Wrath on pull and have it back up for the forth Endless Torment also depending on your group composition and route you might have to play differently.

**General Kaal:**

This fight is pretty stright forward, you can avoid getting the bleed by using Door of Shadows or Divine Steed. If you see a player is about to get 2 stacks of the debuff you can use Blessing of Protection to clear and immune the charge hit. Keep in mind that the shield clears all bleeds so you ideally do not wan't to use any sort of immunity before Gloom Squall.

**Important trash mechanics to use utility on:**

---
**Chamber Sentinel's Severing Slice:** This is the frontal the sentinel does, if one of your players gets hit meanwhile your tank are kiting, Blessing of Protection will fully immune it. You can also soak the bleed intentionally to help your tank (but make sure he's aware your about to do it).

**Research Scribe's Throw Research:** This mob will stand still and cast books on random players, and the damage will scale really high the higher the key level is. Make sure to use Blessing of Protection to immune damage and Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light to delay the casts.

**Grand Overseer's Dread Bindings:** You can pre use Freedom on this mechanic and you won't have to run out to break the chain.

**Depths Warden's Barbed Shackles:** This ability should be interrupted but if it would happen to go through use Freedom immediately.

**Dark Acolyte's Dark Bolt:** This cast becomes very dangerous the higher you go, Use Blinding Light to mass interrupt the casts.

**Wicked Oppressor's Wrack Soul:** Use Hammer of Justice on this cast to mitigate damage if you don't have dispel available.

**Gluttonous Tick's Drain Essence:** Blinding Light and Hammer of Justice should be used frequently on these mobs whenever your group does not have interrupts available.
