### Blightbone

Make sure you're not letting any of the Carrion Worms bite you since when they reach 3 stacks they will explode. You can use Blinding Light or Hammer of Justice to prevent this if for some reason one of your players are face tanking it. If a player in your group does not have a defensive available and gets targeted by the Heaving Retch, Blessing of Sacrifice him and dispel him after.

### Amarth the Harvester

Only time there is anything happening on this fight is during the Tortured Echoes debuff after the Final Harvest cast. Make sure to have some sort of cooldown up for every one of these. You should make sure to play Wrench Evil conduit and Repentance for this dungeon to be able to CC the mages that will spawn after the boss casts Land of the Dead.

### Surgeon Stichflesh

There is zero healing requirement on this fight if it's executed well, this means you should focus your cooldowns on damaging the boss. There might be times where your group falls behind on killing the old add and two Stitchflesh's Creation will be up, make sure to use Blessing of Sacrifice if he does not have any major defensives available to mitigate as much damage as possible. Keep in mind Blessing of Protection works on the fixate.

### Nalthor the Rimebinder

There is a few things to be aware of on this fight and that is to rotate your healing/damage reduction cooldowns on the shields that your dps players does not have any damage cooldowns or any weapons on. Also make sure to pre Blessing of Freedom on the Frozen Binding if its a melee that got targeted. Blessing of Protection will mitigate all damage you take from Blessing of Sacrifice on this boss fight.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Separation Assistant's Morbid Fixation:** Blessing of Protection will fully immune this fixate and should be used to prevent your targeted player having to move away. Keep in mind a hunter should generally Feign Death this, a rogue can Vanish or Evasion and so on.

**Loyal Creations and Goregrind's Tenderize + Mutilate:** You can Blessing of Protection + taunt these two abilities to make it easier for your tank, or if you do not have it available you can Shield of the Righteous and taunt the tenderize to reset your tanks stacks but make sure he's taunting the mob back before the Mutilate.

**Corpse Harvester's Throw Flesh:** The damage from this ability will start to almost one shot the higher the key goes if the player are not prepared. Blessing of Protection will immune this damage. Make sure to use Hammer of Justice and Blinding Light frequently on these mobs.
