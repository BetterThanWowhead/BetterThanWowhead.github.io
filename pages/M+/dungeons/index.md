The key to managing your cooldowns in a dungeon is knowing the route and all the dangerous parts. The biggest thing you want to be aware of is overlapping cooldowns, so if you use Avenging Wrath you ideally don’t want to use Aura Mastery or Divine Shield if its not necessary. It’s important to use your entire utility kit as that's where our strength lies, so let's talk about cooldown usage in mythic+.
