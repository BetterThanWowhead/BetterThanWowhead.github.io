### Hylbrande

Make sure to Blinding Light or Hammer of Justice this.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347094/titanic-crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=347094" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Don't stand in front of the boss.

There is close to zero healing requirement on this boss fight, only thing you have to be aware of is the console. I suggest you getting [This](/M+/weakauras) WeakAura for that.

### Timecap'n Hooktail

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347151/hook-swipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=347151" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Don't stand behind boss!

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347149/infinite-breath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=347149" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Breath that will one-shot the adds.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=350517/double-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=350517" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - This will increase the movement speed and attack speed of all the adds.

If this boss is executed well there will be minimal healing requirement. Keep in mind you can use Blessing of Protection if one of your dps players gets hit by the Hook Swipe, this will also fully immune the debuff. Try your best to kite the adds in front of the boss to make it easier for tank to aim the breath.

### So'leah

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=353635/collapsing-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=353635" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Need to be soaked 4 times & group-wide damage.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=351096/energy-fragmentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=351096" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Dodge.

The most important part of this fight is rotating cooldowns on every Collapsing Star, assuming your group doesn't decide to play the two Adorned Starseer right before the boss, you should have Avenging Wrath for the first Collapsing Star that will happen at 20 seconds roughly, I suggest you to hold Ashen Hallow for phase two unless you will get two usages in the fight (depending on key level). The second star you can use Aura Mastery + Holy Avenger. The third Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice this should be the last one in phase one. Second phase Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath will cover the first one with timewarp/blood lust. Depending if your group skipped the third star in phase one, this will be Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice if not Health Potion + Lay on Hands, keep in mind you have 30 seconds to soak it so you're not in a rush.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---

**Coastwalker Goliath's Tidal Stomp:** This is group-wide damage and a stacking debuff that will increase the damage you take from the next Tidal Stomp. If you're group is pulling this make sure to Aura Mastery the second Tidal Stomp, and the third you can use Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice on.

**Murkbrine Scalebinder's Invigorating Fish Stick:** Make sure to rotate Hammer of Justice and Blinding Light to prevent them from healing themselves.

**Murkbrine Shellcrusher's Cry of Mrrggllrrgg:** Will increase all nearby murlocs damage dealt by 50% for 30 seconds. 

**Burly Deckhand's Super Saison:** This will increase the damage he deal by 100%, make sure to stop this with Blinding Light or Hammer of Justice.

**Hourglass Tidesage's Tidal Burst:** Make sure to use Blinding Light or Hammer of Justice and instead use interrupts on Brackish Bolt.

**Adorned Starseer's Wandering Pulsar:** The pulsar will deal a large amount of AoE damage to your group, make sure to have Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath available for this.

**Devoted Accomplice's Energy Slash:** This is a stacking debuff that increases the damage taken from the next Energy Slashes by 25%. This needs to be dispelled as much as possible.
