<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=348350/interrogation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=348350" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Will fixate the target in the trap (kill the trap before boss reaches). 

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=345770/impound-contraband" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=345770" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Pick up your weapon.

There's very minimal healing requirement on this boss fight and mostly only tank healing. Make sure to use Blessing of Sacrifice whenever your tank doesn't have defensives and when you don't have Avenging Wrath or Holy Avenger active. Every now and then there's a chance that the boss will yoink your weapon and after you pick it up you will gain 25% haste buff, i suggest you to pool holy power to possibly get a Awakening proc for this to maximize the amount of damage you deal.

### The Menagerie

**Alcruux:**

---
The only thing to do on this boss is dodging.

**Achillite:**

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=349954/purification-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=349954" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Dispel.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=345770/impound-contraband" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=345770" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Walk into blue orbs on the ground. (Transfer it to someone that has cooldowns coming back up).

Only things to be aware of on this boss is dispelling your squishiest target on the Purification and if you get targeted by Gluttonous Feast walk into the blue orbs as it will provide you with 5% damage increase (stacking up to 20 times). Make sure to pool holy power on this for Awakening procs to maximize the damage you deal within the damage buff.

**Venza Goldfuse:**

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=350101/chains-of-damnation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=350101" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Will chain one player.

Venza will every now and then do Whirling Annihilation, make sure to have Divine Steed or Door of Shadows available for this since it will drag you towards the boss and kill you. Keep in mind you can pre Blessing of Freedom the Chains.

### P.O.S.T Master

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=346742/fan-mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=346742" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide damage.

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=346962/money-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=346962" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - AoE soak.

It's important that you have a cooldown available for every Fan Mail on this boss fight. If you use Ashen Hallow + Avenging Wrath when the first Fan Mail happens (at 15-18 seconds ish) It will also cover the Second Fan Mail and the first Money Order, the third Fan Mail you should use Holy Avenger (early) and also Aura Mastery (late) for it to cover the second Money Order when people are low health. The Forth Fan Mail will be a difficoult one, pool holy power and use Health Potion since you cant afford to use Divine Shield here since this is not a Fan Mail + Money Order combo. The fifth you can use Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice, this will also cover the Money Order. if you're getting one more Fan Mail, you should have Avenging Wrath back up for this. Make sure to use Door of Shadows and Divine Steed frequently to deal with the bombs.

### Myza's Oasis

**Disruptive Patron:** 

---

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=353783/teleport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=353783" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Use Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light on this to prevent him from teleporting.

**Oasis Security:**

---

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=350916/security-slam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=350916" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Large tank hit.

**Zo'gron**

---

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355438/suppression-spark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=355438" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Group-wide damage.

On this boss fight you want to use Avenging Wrath after the first Pentatonic Performance with the damage increase and you will have it backup for when you're going to use Ashen Hallow on the main boss. Keep in mind Zo'gron will do the same tank hit as the Oasis Security does, if he does not have any defensives available for whatever reason use Blessing of Sacrifice to mitigate damage. The Suppression Spark doesn't really require any healing cooldowns but you can use Aura Mastery whenever you see that your group doesn't have any defensives ready.

### So'amzi

<a class="external" href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347392/deploy-relocators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wowhead="spell=347392" data-wh-icon-size="small"></a> - Walk into the correct teleporter to avoid the Shuri debuff.

There's zero healing requirement on this fight aslong people are good at walking through correct symbol and dodging the dash. If someone is getting hit by the dash you can use Blessing of Protection to fully immune the debuff.

### Important trash mechanics to use utility on

---
**Customs Security's Teleport:** Prevent the teleport with Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light.

**Gatewarden Zo'mazz and Armored Overseer's Proxy Strike:** Since this is not a cast you can't prevent it from happening, be aware these two mobs will deal a lot of damage to your tank.

**Interrogation Specialist's Glyph of Restraint:** Blessing of Freedom will fully immune the additional hit and clear the debuff, whenever Blessing of Freedom is on cooldown use your dispel.

**Portalmancer Zo'honn's Radiant Pulse:** This mob will apply a large AoE ticking DoT on your group, you can pop Aura Mastery pre-pull and cover the first Pulse after that use Holy Avenger 5-10 seconds before next to force proc Avenging Wrath, if you get a third Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice. (keep in mind this scales with fortified since it is not actually a part of the boss fight).

**Tracker Zo'korss Lockdown:** This mob will root your tank, make sure to use Blessing of Freedom or Dispel to allow him to move away from the lasers.

**Cartel Skulker's Quick Blade:** If someone in your stands in the dash they will be taking a large amount of ticking damage over 10 seconds, use Blessing of Protection immedietly to clear this debuff.

**Market Peacekeeper's Phalanx Field:** Every now and then this mob will cast a defensive stance and reduce the damage it takes by 75%, this can be prevented with Hammer of Justice or Blinding Light.

**Commander Zo'far and Commerce Enforcer's Power Kick:** This is a hard tank hit, make sure to use Blessing of Sacrifice if your tank does not have a defensive available.

**Veteran Sparkcaster's Scintillate:** Will cause whoever the debuff goes on take 10% increased Arcane damage taken for 12 seconds (and stacks), make sure to dispel this.

**Overloaded Mailemental:** When this mob dies it will leave a purple  that wilbubblel give you 50% haste when you stand inside of it.
