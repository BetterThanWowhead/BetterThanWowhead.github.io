**Blessing of the Seasons:**

While you're playing this you'll feel that these buffs are mostly very undertuned and you will notice the lack of healing throughput outside of Avenging Wrath. That being said there is currently a bug that makes Blessing of Summer have a 80% chance to do 60% extra damage instead of 40% chance which makes it an incredibly strong damage cooldown on 3 minutes. 

You will not see any play of Night Fae in higher than the average keys for the reasons mentioned above but it could potentionally be good with a very specefic comp in a MDI situation or for damage log runs for fun.

It will rotate in the following order on a 45 seconds cooldown:

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328620/blessing-of-summer" data-wowhead="spell=328620"></a>: blesses an ally causing their attacks to have an additional chance to deal holy damage.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328622/blessing-of-autumn" data-wowhead="spell=32862"></a>: blesses an ally causing their cooldowns to recover 30% faster for the duration of the buff.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328281/blessing-of-winter" data-wowhead="spell=328281"></a>: blesses an ally causing their attacks to deal additional damage and apply a movement and attack speed stacking debuff.

<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=328282/blessing-of-spring" data-wowhead="spell=328282"></a>: blesses an ally with 10% increased healing done and 20% healing received.

Here you can see the best targets to use [Blessing of Summer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TpJwONNo-CBkJRd9KzTNwvBW9MzIHmPoddZjKWOO1do/edit?usp=sharing) on.

**Soulshape:**

This will provide you with a large amount of mobility on a 2 minute cooldown.

**Soulbind and Conduits:**

Your soulbind setup as Night Fae should look something like this: [Korayn](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/korayn/paladin/AwaW6r4CBS1ECiUtdAoSBTDZCiUwEAoiFStjCiUsqgo), if you would ever decide to play this in keys you should change 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339316/echoing-blessings" data-wowhead="spell=339316"></a> for 
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339124/pure-concentration" data-wowhead="spell=339124"></a> when you are playing Mists of Tirna Scithe because this will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. Playing <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=339292/wrench-evil" data-wowhead="spell=339292"></a> instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall will help you a ton since there is a lot of mobs you have/can use Turn Evil on and this conduit will reduce the cast timer by a large amount.

**Best Legendaries:**

Note: All these legendaries should be crafted with Haste and Versatility if you are a mythic+ focused player.

Crafting Priority:

1. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=355100/seasons-of-plenty" data-wowhead="spell=355100"></a> since this the only reason night fae is somewhat viable this is your number one priority to craft.

2. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337594/the-mad-paragon" data-wowhead="spell=337594"></a> if you want to minmax your damage this should be your number two priority to craft.

3. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=337825/shock-barrier" data-wowhead="spell=337825"></a> this is a great choice if you feel like you need some more healing, that being said since we're not playing Crusader's Might as a talent the healing from this legendary wont be game changing.
