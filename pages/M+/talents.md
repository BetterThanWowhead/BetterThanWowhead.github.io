<details>
  <summary>Crusader's Might</summary>
  This talent loses value for Venthyr Holy Paladin, since we're not using Glimmer of Light or Shock Barrier in mythic+. That being said, this is still a very competitive talent pick and should definitely be played for explosive weeks.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Bestow Faith</summary>
  I would personally not recommend playing this ever, but there is scenarios where it could be useful, for example in Sanguine Depths on first or third boss where you can pre cast Bestow Faith before the mechanic happens and gain 1 holy power for free. This being said the healing throughput is not a huge difference and Light's Hammer will contribute more healing in the relevant windows.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Light's Hammer</summary>
  This should be your go to talent as Venthyr in every dungeon. This will provide you with a solid amount of damage on a one minute cooldown.

  </div>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Saved by the Light</summary>
  This talent should only be played if you're using Beacon of Virtue because of the synergy, it will provide all your 4 Beacon targets with a solid absorb when they fall below 30% health.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Judgement of Light</summary>
  This is your best talent pick for any covenant, because its a very efficient healing source since you're using Judgement as much as possible in mythic+.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Holy Prism</summary>
  This talent is very mana inefficient and costs you a GCD every 20 seconds for very minor damage difference and should generally never be played except for on explosive weeks.

  </div>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Fist of Justice</summary>
  This should almost never be played in m+ because having a AoE disorient will generally be more useful in most scenarios.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Repentance</summary>
  This talent should only be used to CC the mages on second boss Necrotic Wake so your group can ignore playing them completely.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Blinding Light</summary>
  This should be your default pick in keys. You can use this to mass interrupt uninterruptible casts like Bucking Rampage in Mists of Tirna Scithe or interrupt the Curse of Obliteration in Halls of Atonement. I would suggest you to take a look at [Dungeons](/M+/dungeons) for more important trash mechanics to use this ability on.

  </div>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Unbreakable Spirit</summary>
  This talent is a absolute must in keys, it will provide you with a 30% cooldown reduction on Divine Shield, Lay on Hands and Divine Protection.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Cavalier</summary>
  Don't play this.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Rule of Law</summary>
  This talent should never be played even if you are playing with a full range comp, Rule of Law won't be comparable to Unbreakable Spirit. Rule of Law does also not work with any of your Blessings.
</details>

  </div>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Divine Purpose</summary>
  This talent synergises very well with Awakening but since Divine Purpose is rng this loses quite abit of value for Venthyr in keys because you never want your throughput to be rng dependent.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Holy Avenger</summary>
  This will not only provide you with a strong healing cooldown to force proc wings in between your Ashen Hallows, but also a strong AoE damage cooldown if you're not in need of extra throughput. This should always be your default pick as venthyr in keys.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Seraphim</summary>
  As Venthyr this talent has close to zero synergy and should never be played in any relevant content for a few reasons, 1) it does not synergise at all with Awakening which means you are decreasing your Avenging Wrath uptime, 2) 25% of the talent goes to waste since it provides you with Mastery which does not contribute any damage for Holy Paladins, 3) it doesn't line up with Avenging Wrath at all after the first usage, 4) it cost you one GCD and 3 holy power for minor single target damage gain. That being said, for Kyrian this should 100% be played in mythic+ because it synergises very well with Mikanikos Divine Toll CDR on AoE.
</details>


### T45

  <div class="column">

  </div>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Sanctified Wrath</summary>
  This talent is good to empower your Avenging Wrath even more, but should never be necessary because Avenging Wrath is already a very strong cooldown.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Avenging Crusader</summary>
  This is a very bad talent pick and should never be played for a few reasons, it doesn't provide you with anywhere near the same amount of damage as the two other options, the healing you gain from it isn't a smart heal which means if one of your players are at 10% health and another at 80% it won't prioritise the 10% health player, also a very none mana efficient talent.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Awakening</summary>
  This should be your default pick in keys, because it provides you with very constant throughput, scales very well with haste and allows you to force proc Avenging Wrath with Holy Avenger for dangerous situations.
</details>

  </div>
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Glimmer of Light</summary>
  Glimmer of Light no longer has the synergies that once made its healing strong, so most of its power comes from retaining your single full power beacon. In dungeons that we frequently need to deal with large incoming AoE healing Beacon of Faith generally performs better. That being said Glimmer of Light can still be used for lower keys and will help quite abit with tank healing if he is inexperienced.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Beacon of Faith</summary>
  This talent will help you a ton with AoE healing, and synergises very well with the anima power Self Embalming Kit, you want to put your second Beacon on a squishy dps and funnel Beacon healing from yourself. This should be your default pick in keys.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Beacon of Virtue</summary>
  This will provide you with a large amount of AoE burst healing, but does not contribute any damage also becomes very mana inefficient fast and forces you to clutter your GCDs with spells you generally do not want to cast regularly in your rotation.
