**T15**
Light’s Hammer

Crusader’s Might loses value since we’re not running Glimmer of Light or Shock Barrier as Venthyr. Light’s Hammer will not bring much healing but a solid amount of Damage.

**T25**
Judgement of Light

JoL will bring you a lot of passive healing throughput since your casting Judgement on cooldown in m+.

**T30**
Blinding Light

You should always pick this talent in every dungeon. This will allow you to cc uninterruptable cast like Buckling Rampage in Mists or just mass interrup multiple mobs.


or Repentance

This talent is only used for CCing the mages on second boss Necrotic Wake so you can ignore playing them completly.

**T35**
Unbreakable Spirit

this talent is a absolute must in m+ due to how often we should be using our defensive abilities. Turning Divine Shield into a 3.5 minute cooldown also means we can treat it more like a Healing/Damage Cooldown instead of saving it just for an emergency.

**T40**
Holy Avenger

This is a very powerfull cooldown which will increase your holy power generation by 3x. You can either use this to force proc wings to get throught difficoult parts of the dungeons. You can also pair it with Avenging Wrath for Damage.

**T45**
Awakening

This talent scales very well with haste and will provide you with the most constant throughput.

**T50**
Beacon of Faith

BoF will help you a lot with aoe healing, and synergises very well with the anima power Self Embalming Kit, You wanna putt your second beacon on a squishy dps and funnel beacon healing from healing yourself.

This will be your go to build for high keys as venthyr.

### **Gearing**

### **Stat priority:**

Intellect > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery.

You should always prioritise Intellect during first few tiers of a expansion, this might change later into the expansion.

### **Haste:**

 is our strongest secondary because holy power generation. There’s no breakpoints or softcaps stack it until mana becomes a issue.

### **Versatility:**

 is our second best stat because it gives us the highest Damage/Healing throughput also provides us with a solid amount of Damage Reduction.
### **Critical Strike:**
Since we rarely use Infusion of Light procs Critical Strike loses a lot of value but still provides a decent amount of Healing/damage throughput which putts it Above Mastery.

### **Mastery:** 
Mastery is still a solid choice for raw healing throughput. But it has no effect on our damage, which in Mythic+ is the biggest part of what we do. The healing it contributes is also too deepent on comp composition and positioning.

### **Best Legendarys:**

Mad Paragon will be your best legendary for Venthyr as it will greatly increase our damage we do inside Ashen Hallow.

Shock Barrier is our strongest healing legendary in m+ and are also 100% passive, This would be your legendary if you wan’t more healing.

### **On use Trinkets:**
---
[Soulletting Ruby](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178809/soulletting-ruby?bonus=6805:1472)
This is a very strong on use trinket since it lines up with wings(Do not keybind this into wings) since you wanna use it on a low health target whenever you can.

[Inscrutable Quantum Device](https://www.wowhead.com/item=179350/inscrutable-quantum-device?bonus=6805:1472)
I personally prefer Quantum Device over Ruby because iqd provides you a large amount of extra burst damage in your Ashen Hallow.

### **Passive Trinkets:**

[Titanic Ocular Gland](https://www.wowhead.com/item=186423/titanic-ocular-gland?bonus=6805)
Is your strongest passive trinket since it provides you the most amount of stats (if your above 50% health which you should be most of the time) playing this trinket requires you to optimise your gear since it provides you an increase to your highest secondary stat.

[Unbound Changeling](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708/unbound-changeling?bonus=6805:1472)
Will be your second best passive trinket if you dont have Ocular Gland because it provides you with either Haste or Crit (deepnding on your food buff) you should ideally have it sett to Haste at all time.

### **Soulbinds:**
---
You go to soulbind should be theotar since its the highest damage soulbind for your entire grp because Wastelands Propreity also it gives you 3% tea that will either give you Intellect, Haste, Vers or crit.

Your setup should look something like this [Thetotar Soulbind.](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/theotar-the-mad-duke/paladin/Awa-774CBS1ECBUtdAgSBTD0CCUwEAgiFStjCDUsqgg) You should change Echoing Blessing for Pure Concentration conduit for Mists of Tirna Scithe because you will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. And also play Wrench Evil instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall.

If you pug 24+ keys you can also play General Draven as a soulbind this will provide you with more surivibility and similar personal damage but less grp damage.

Your setup should look something like this [General Draven Soulbind.](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/general-draven/paladin/AwaWb5YCFS1ECCUtdAgSBTD0CCUwEAghBStjCA)
