# Talents

Let’s talk about talents.

T15
Light’s Hammer.
Crusader’s Might loses value since we’re not running Glimmer of Light or Shock Barrier as Venthyr. Light’s Hammer will not bring much healing but a solid amount of Damage.

T25.
Judgement of Light.
JoL will bring you a lot of passive healing throughput since your casting Judgement on cooldown in m+.

T30.
Repentance.
This talent is only used for CCing the mages on second boss Necrotic Wake so you can ignore playing them completly.

Blinding Light.
You should always pick this talent in every other dungeon. This will allow you to cc uninterruptable cast like Buckling Rampage in Mistsor just mass interrup multiple mobs.

T35
Unbreakable Spirit.
this talent is a absolute must in m+ due to how often we should be using our defensive abilities. Turning Divine Shield into a 3.5 minute cooldown also means we can treat it more like a Healing/Damage Cooldown instead of saving it just for an emergency.

T40
Holy Avenger.
This is a very powerfull cooldown which will increase your holy power generation by 3x. You can either use this to force proc wings to get throught difficoult parts of the dungeons. You can also pair it with Avenging Wrath for Damage.

T45
Awakening.
This talent scales very well with haste and will provide you with the most constant throughput.

T50
Beacon of Faith.
BoF will help you a lot with aoe healing, and synergises very well with the anima power Self Embalming Kit, You wanna putt your second beacon on a squishy dps and funnel beacon healing from healing yourself.

This will be your go to build for high keys as venthyr.

# Gear

## Stat priority.

Intellect > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery.

You should always prioritise Intellect during first few tiers of a expansion.

Haste is our strongest secondary because holy power generation. There’s no breakpoints or softcaps stack it until mana becomes a issue.

Versatility is our second best stat because it gives us the highest Damage/Healing throughput also provides us with a solid amount of Damage Reduction.

Since we rarely use Infusion of Light procs crit loses a lot of value but still provides a decent amount of Healing/damage throughput which putts it at our third best stat. Above Mastery.

Mastery is still a solid choice for raw healing throughput. But it has no effect on our damage, which in Mythic+ is a significant part of what we do. Its healing contributions are also variant on group composition and dungeon since positioning varies so much in Mythic+, making this a much less reliable hps choice then any of our other secondaries.

## Best Legendarys.

Mad Paragon will be your best legendary for Venthyr as it will greatly increase our damage we do inside Ashen Hallow.

Shock Barrier is our strongest healing legendary in m+ and are also 100% passive, This would be your legendary if you wan’t more healing.

## On use Trinkets.

[Soulletting Ruby](#https://www.wowhead.com/item=178809/soulletting-ruby?bonus=6805:1472)
This is a very strong on use trinket since it lines up with wings(Do not keybind this into wings) since you wanna use it on a low health target whenever you can.

[Inscrutable Quantum Device](#https://www.wowhead.com/item=179350/inscrutable-quantum-device?bonus=6805:1472)
I personally prefer Quantum Device over Ruby because iqd provides you a large amount of extra burst damage in your Ashen Hallow.

## Passive Trinkets.

[Titanic Ocular Gland](#https://www.wowhead.com/item=186423/titanic-ocular-gland?bonus=6805)
Is your strongest passive trinket since it provides you the most amount of stats (if your above 50% health which you should be most of the time) playing this trinket requires you to optimise your gear since it provides you an increase to your highest secondary stat.

[Unbound Changeling](#https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708/unbound-changeling?bonus=6805:1472)
Will be your second best passive trinket if you dont have Ocular Gland because it provides you with either Haste or Crit (deepnding on your food buff) you should ideally have it sett to Haste at all time because if you get the proc inside your Ashen Hallow you will gain some more ticks.

# Soulbinds.

You go to soulbind should be theotar since its the highest damage soulbind for your entire grp because Wastelands Propreity also it gives you 3% tea that will either give you Intellect, Haste, Vers or crit.

Your setup should look something like this [Thetotar Soulbind.](#https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/theotar-the-mad-duke/paladin/Awa-774CBS1ECBUtdAgSBTD0CCUwEAgiFStjCDUsqgg) You should change Echoing Blessing for Pure Concentration conduit for Mists of Tirna Scithe because you will reduce the fear effect on first boss by one second if your conduit is maxed out. And also play Wrench Evil instead of Echoing Blessing for Necrotic Wake and Plaguefall.

If you pug 24+ keys you can also play General Draven as a soulbind this will provide you with more surivibility and similar personal damage but less grp damage.

Your setup should look something like this [General Draven Soulbind.](#https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/general-draven/paladin/AwaWb5YCFS1ECCUtdAgSBTD0CCUwEAghBStjCA)
