Before we get into cooldown management in dungeons, let's talk about all the different affixes and how to properly deal with them/what you can do to make your life easier.

### Bolstering 
---

If you are Venthyr your priority damage will make a noticeable difference so it's important that you are focusing your damage into the correct target to avoid making the pull an disaster to deal with.

### Grievous
--- 

This is a very unfun and bad affix for any healer in general to deal with since it will greatly decrease the damage you do. However to make this as easy as possible you want to focus healing one player at a time (generally the one with most stacks and get him above 90% health) first rather than to try heal multiple peoples at same time. Blessing of Protection clears Grievous. One more thing you have to be aware of is that, not every healing source clears a Grievous stack, *Holy Shock, Holy Light, Flash of Light, Light of the Martyr, Word of Glory, Lay on Hands, Bestow Faith and lastly Holy Prism if you use it on a (friendly player)* is the only abilities we have that clears it.

### Bursting
---

This affix can be very rough for Holy Paladins to deal especially in pug groups, so it's important that you are using your dispel on the squishiest player in your group, frequently using Aura Mastery, Divine Shield + Blessing of Sacrifice to mitigate as much damage taken as possible.

### Raging
---

There is a few mobs that becomes incredibly dangerous on raging especially since you are not able to soothe every single one of them instantly, I suggest you to hold Hammer of Justice and Blinding Light for Raging at (30% health) to mitigate as much damage taken as possible.

</a>

### Spiteful
---

A terrible affix design and very bad for melees in general, you can use Hammer of Justice to allow one of your team members to stay in and deal damage rather than run out of melee.

    <img src="/assets/img/Affixes/Sanguine.jpg" class="affix_icons"/>
</a>

### Sanguine
---

Sanguine can be a bit tricky for your tank, what you can do to help is that you can taunt mobs with low health out from rest of the pull to make it easier for your tank to deal with. This will also potentially increasing your groups damage since he don't have to move all the other mobs out from ground effects such as Blizzard, Earthquake or Rain of Fire etc.

### Explosive
---

On Explosive weeks I recommend you to use a mouseover melee hit macro to be able to do multiple Explosives in one global.

<a>
    <img src="/assets/img/Affixes/Storming.jpg" class="affix_icons"/>
</a>

### Storming
---

Another awful affix for the melee players, I highly recommend you to actually soak a few Stormings now and then to help your tank out as much as possible, there's situations where it can be lethal for your tank to get hit by a Storming.

### Quaking
---

A very easy affix to deal with, just make sure to not clip the tank or any other player in general.

<a>
    <img src="/assets/img/Affixes/Volcanic.jpg" class="affix_icons"/>
</a>

### Volcanic
---

Volcanic canâ€™t spawn in melee which makes it a completely irrelevant affix (assuming you have any range dps in your group).

### Thundering
