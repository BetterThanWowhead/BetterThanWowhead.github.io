### **On use**

[Soulletting Ruby](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178809/soulletting-ruby?bonus=6805:1472)
this is a very strong on use trinket since it lines up with wings (do not keybind this into wings) since you want to use it on a low health target whenever you can.

[Inscrutable Quantum Device](https://www.wowhead.com/item=179350/inscrutable-quantum-device?bonus=6805:1472)
i personally prefer Quantum Device over Ruby because iqd provides you a large amount of extra burst damage inside your Ashen Hallow.

### **Passive**

[Titanic Ocular Gland](https://www.wowhead.com/item=186423/titanic-ocular-gland?bonus=6805)
your strongest passive trinket since it provides you the most amount of stats (if your above 50% health which you should be most of the time) playing this trinket requires you to optimise your gear since it provides you an increase to your highest secondary stat.

[Unbound Changeling](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708/unbound-changeling?bonus=6805:1472)
will be your second best passive trinket if you don't have Ocular Gland because it will provide you with either Haste, Crit or Mastery (depnding on your food buff) you should ideally have it set to Haste at all time.

[Flask of the Solemn Night](https://www.wowhead.com/item=137484/flask-of-the-solemn-night?bonus=1826:1472) the uptime variance is very high on this trinket and Unbound Changeling is generally always better in a mythic+ situation, but this is definitely a good trinket to farm for when legion timewalking are available, because you will gain quite a few extra Ashen Hallow ticks if you get lucky.
