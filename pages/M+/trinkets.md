### On use

[Resonant Reservoir](https://www.wowhead.com/item=188272/resonant-reservoir) This trinket will provide you with a large amount of AoE damage and will by far be your best in slot. Paladins can actually not loot this by themselfs and have to be traded it.

[Inscrutable Quantum Device](https://www.wowhead.com/item=179350/inscrutable-quantum-device?bonus=6805:1472) Will be your second best on-use trinket if you do not have Resonant Reservoir. Just imagine its a 4 minute cooldown instead of three.

### Passive

[Elegy of the Eternals](https://ptr.wowhead.com/item=188270/elegy-of-the-eternals?bonus=6805) will be your strongest passive trinket at item level 278 (assuming you don't have a 272-278 So'leah's). The value of this will increase even more if multiple players with the same covenant in your group.

[Unbound Changeling](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708/unbound-changeling?bonus=6805:1472)
will be your second best passive trinket as it will provide you with a large proc of either Haste, Crit or Mastery (depending on your food buff) you should ideally have it set to Haste at all times.

[So'leah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185818/soleahs-secret-technique?bonus=6805) play this if you don't have Elegy at 278 item level. It will provide you with a solid amount of secondary stats. You generally want to have it set to Haste or Versatility.
