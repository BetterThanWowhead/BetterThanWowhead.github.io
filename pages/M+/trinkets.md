### On use

[Inscrutable Quantum Device](https://www.wowhead.com/item=179350/inscrutable-quantum-device?bonus=6805:1472) Is still a solid choice for burst damage within Ashen hallow, you just imagine its a 4 minute cooldown instead of three.

### Passive

[So'leah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185818/soleahs-secret-technique?bonus=6805)
your strongest passive trinket since it will provide you with a solid amount of secondary stats. You generally want to have it set to Haste or Versatility.

[Elegy of the Eternals](https://ptr.wowhead.com/item=188270/elegy-of-the-eternals?bonus=6805) will be the play instead of So'leah's if you have multiple people playing it while being the same covenant as you.

[Unbound Changeling](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708/unbound-changeling?bonus=6805:1472)
will be your second best passive trinket as it will provide you with a large proc of either Haste, Crit or Mastery (depending on your food buff) you should ideally have it set to Haste at all times.

[Flask of the Solemn Night](https://www.wowhead.com/item=137484/flask-of-the-solemn-night?bonus=1826:1472) the uptime variance is very high on this trinket and Unbound Changeling is generally always better in a mythic+ situation, but this is definitely a good trinket to farm for when legion Timewalking are available, since this will provide you with quite a few extra Ashen Hallow ticks if you get lucky.
