### **On use:**

---

[Soulletting Ruby](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178809/soulletting-ruby?bonus=6805:1472)
This is a very strong on use trinket since it lines up with wings (Do not keybind this into wings) since you wanna use it on a low health target whenever you can.

[Inscrutable Quantum Device](https://www.wowhead.com/item=179350/inscrutable-quantum-device?bonus=6805:1472)
I personally prefer Quantum Device over Ruby because iqd provides you a large amount of extra burst damage in your Ashen Hallow.

### **Passive:**

[Titanic Ocular Gland](https://www.wowhead.com/item=186423/titanic-ocular-gland?bonus=6805)
Is your strongest passive trinket since it provides you the most amount of stats (if your above 50% health which you should be most of the time) playing this trinket requires you to optimise your gear since it provides you an increase to your highest secondary stat.

[Unbound Changeling](https://www.wowhead.com/item=178708/unbound-changeling?bonus=6805:1472)
Will be your second best passive trinket if you dont have Ocular Gland because it provides you with either Haste or Crit (deepnding on your food buff) you should ideally have it sett to Haste at all time.
