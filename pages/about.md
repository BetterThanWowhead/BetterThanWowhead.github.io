Hello!

I'm a high mythic+ Holy Paladin and multi CE healer, if you have any questions about me or else send me a dm on discord.

**How do i play?**

In heavvy movement situations i use targeting macros (known as pvp macros) and when there is not a lot of movement i play with normal mouseover macros.

I also use two different sorts of macros for Lay on Hands and Blessing of Sacrifice, one that casts it on tank only since its off the GCD and i want to be able to use it as quickly as possible without having to move my mouse around, also one that is mouseover if i would have to cast these abilities on another player.

For Explosive weeks, i use mouseover Crusader Strike.

My playstyle is very niche compared to how other people play but one thing i can recommend to anyone is a focus Hammer of Justice macro, this is very useful in a mythic+ situation since it will allow you to not have to tab or move your mouse around to target whatever you need to stun.

Macros/keybindings are very personal, you should play with whatever you prefer.

**may u needs ✨**
